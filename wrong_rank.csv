Sanderink succeeds Erik Hermsen, who took over his duties after Sanderink’s departure earlier this year. Hermsen worked at Strukton for 22 years until his immediate departure on Friday and will focus on other “administrative and supervisory roles”, according to the report. the press release. Sanderink has been discredited in recent years due to various quarrels and scandals within his companies, which, in addition to Strukton, also include IT company Centric and engineering company Antea. He therefore left both parent company Oranjewoud (of which Sanderink also owns) and Strukton, but is now a director there again. A spokesperson for Strukton answers questions from NRC unable to comment further on Hermsen’s departure. “He has contributed a lot to the company, but now he is going in a different direction in his career.” According to her, the unrest surrounding Sanderink is also “over”. To get the company out of the red, the company says it has recently tightened its strategy. According to the spokesperson, the management of Strukton Groep now has ‘shorter lines’ with the various parts. “We make better strategic choices, and no longer take on risky projects.” In 2019, the company still suffered a loss of 19.7 million euros, but according to the spokesperson, the profit has been made again in the first half of 2021. The company has more than 6,500 employees. Oranjewoud’s subsidiaries have been plagued by scandals since 2019, and one director or director after another has left. In February 2019, the FIOD raided Strukton’s headquarters in an investigation into corruption and forgery surrounding the contract for a metro project in Riad, Saudi Arabia. The investigation is still ongoing. There was also great dissatisfaction with the way in which Sanderink tried to solve Strukton’s financial problems by taking money away from the other companies. In addition, there was increasing concern within the companies about Sanderink’s own behavior. In July 2019, the fourth board member left IT company Centric, one of the other companies. The reason for this was an article in NRC about the influence of the controversial self-proclaimed cyber expert Van Rijbroek, with whom Sanderink has had a relationship since 2019, on the company. Also read: The last eruption was one too many for entrepreneur Gerard Sanderink Sanderink also accused his ex-girlfriend Brigitte van Egten, who headed several companies under Oranjewoud, of fraud and theft. However, the FIOD has found no evidence for this. Hermsen became involved in this conflict when Van Egten had information on Sanderink’s telephone and computer seized at Strukton’s office. Sanderink threatened both Hermsen and the inspector during the seizure, after which Hermsen asked Sanderink to calm down in another room. During the time-out, Sanderink’s phone was remotely erased, and evidence may have been destroyed, Van Egt’s counsel said. NRC know. In June it wrote FD that Hermsen would have been suspended, based on a conversation with Herman Spenkelink, a supervisory director at Oranjewoud. A spokesperson for Strukton denies this, saying that Hermsen had a conversation with Sanderink and was said to have been ill for a few days. Sanderink has long owned the vast majority of Oranjewoud’s shares. In February, the company announced that Sanderink’s investment company would own the remaining 0.9 percent of the shares wanted to buy up. At that time, that involved almost 575,000 shares. The intention is to end the listing of Oranjewoud on the Euronext Amsterdam after completion of the buy-out. It is not known when that will be, but the process is running “according to plan”, according to a spokesperson. Only a small volume of Oranjewoud shares are currently tradable.

The FD says the payments to prince Mishaal bin Abudalaziz al Sauid via a middle man enabled Strukton to work on developing a metro network in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The prince has since died. The paper bases its claims on information received following a raid on Strukton’s headquarters in Utrecht on February 15. Strukton chairman Gerard Sanderink said in a reaction that there is no question of bribery being involved. ‘The project was awarded on the basis of the lowest price,’ he said. ‘We have been told that the FIOD based the decision for the raid on audits by the tax authorities, leading to suspicion of corruption and false declarations when obtaining a contract for the metro project in Riyadh. We fully cooperate and provide full insight to the FIOD,’ the company statement said. Strukton is one of several companies involved in the multi-billion euro project to build six metro lines in Riyadh that will run for a total length of 176 kilometres across the city and includes 85 stations.

Amsterdam's trademark canals should be drained in sections so that underground parking, shops and cinemas can be built to ease the space shortage in the Dutch capital, according to an ambitious plan launched on Tuesday. REUTERS/Michael Kooren Construction company Strukton, owned by the Dutch railway, proposed building an underground city six floors deep under the picturesque canals, which would be drained section by section while construction takes place and then refilled with water. The web-like complex could be used for parking, sport halls, cinemas and warehouses, and accessed by car from the highway that circles the city, with exits for pedestrians around the city, Strukton said, launching architect's plans: here “It is a sustainable and realizable plan. Expanding a city underground is not futuristic but a necessity in today’s world,” said Bas Obladen, a senior Strukton adviser. The city has signaled support for the plan but would have to take a decision before work could go ahead, Strukton spokesman Youssef Eddini said. Residents of the historic houses that line Amsterdam’s central ring of canals have to wait years for parking permits and a garage space can cost as much as 100,000 euros ($147,800). The one-way streets on either side of the water are often blocked for hours by delivery and rubbish trucks, making it far quicker to travel by bicycle. Eddini said the plan could cost about 10 billion euros and take up to 20 years to realize, but would pay for itself by creating a huge amount of space, cutting the cost of a garage parking spot to 25,000 euros. “It’s a solution for the future of Amsterdam. If we continue in this way Amsterdam will be closed for cars,” he said. Strukton is working on a metro hub under Amsterdam central station for a much-delayed new subway line linking the north and south of the city that has caused traffic chaos for years. The old center of Amsterdam was built on swampy marshland and many of the houses along the canals are still supported by wooden poles, but Eddini said it would be easier to dig and build in the clay under the canal water. He said the new plan would not cause as much disruption as the new metro line: “All materials could be brought to the site by water. We can use the canals as a road.” Reporting by Emma Thomasson, editing by Tim Pearce Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Here’s why trial run has been held up Though the order for the inductor was made in June, much time has been wasted in bringing it to Kurla car-shed, where currently the train is undergoing maintenance, officials said. The AC rake manufactured by the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) and Strukton, a Netherlands-based firm, had arrived in Mumbai on April 1. CR authorities had already missed its earlier deadlines (May 16, June 30 and August 31) of conducting static trials. “Improper co-ordination between the manufacturers and CR authorities delayed the inductor for conducting trials. The instrument supposed to come in June will now be hopefully received by September, post which commissioning can be expected to begin trials,” a CR official said. Static trials of the rake will test the interface between the software and the equipment installed. Officials confirmed that out of a fourteen-day schedule of this phase of trials, thirteen have already been completed and the wait continues for the inductor. “Our team has successfully completed majority of trials of the AC rake. We are waiting for the inductor to be received, post which trials will be re-run to check smooth co-ordination between the motor coach and other coaches. The rake cannot be considered fit to run without doing so,” he added. Commissioning permission can be availed of by mid-September if the inductor is in place with CR authorities by September 1. The trials can begin from September 30 post which dynamic trials of the rake can be started. However, officials seem puzzled on deciding the line for conducting the trials. “As height of the AC rake could clash with some railway-over- bridges (ROBs) between route of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST)-Kurla, conducting dynamic trials there will be difficult. Also, problems exist with conducting trials on trans-harbor line as well. It may thus run on the route between Kurla-Karjat or Kasara and then on Western Railway (WR) line for trials,” a senior CR official said. Also, officials confirmed it is too early to think about deciding fares or marking routes. “The rake is yet to qualify many trials. It may run on WR if Commission of Railway Safety certifies so. There is also a possibility that other AC rakes manufactured would be lower in height and would run on CR,” the official added. It is only after the prototype rake is set in place that the other AC rakes are constructed on a similar model. “After specifications are given to the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) about smooth running of this rake, the next one will come within a month. It is necessary that the first AC rake runs with the second in place as any operational issue with the first will require an immediate replacement with the second,” the official added. The Railways had placed an order for ten air-conditioned rakes from BHEL. Built at a cost of Rs 54 crore, the entire rake would be vestibule-connected and has a seating capacity of 1,208 and standing capacity of 4,936 passengers.   Mississippi man sentenced to 8 years for trying to join Islamic State Neha Kulkarni",0.5122,7,48

 The new plant, known as the Palmerah Tidal Bridge, will be built into a floating 800 metre-long bridge on the Larantuka Strait in East Flores, and promises to deliver power capacity of 18 to 23 megawatts (MW), providing enough electricity for 100,000 people in the area. It is the first deal to emerge from a strategic hydropower alliance between the Indonesian and Dutch governments. A second phase of construction could see capacity increased to 90 to 115 MW, enough power for more than half a million Indonesians in a region that largely relies on polluting diesel generators for electricity. An artist’s impression of the Palmerah Tidal Bridge. Image: Tidal Bridge BV  Environmental group Greenpeace has said that it approves of the project as an alternative to coal in fossil fuels-dependent Indonesia, but that caution is needed to ensure that the biodiversity of the marine environment is not affected. Tidal power is a relatively uncommon form of renewable energy that harnesses the energy of marine currents, a potentially more reliable power source than wind or the sun. The International Energy Agency estimates that in 2014, global tidal power capacity was about 0.5GW, compared to 128GW of solar and 8.8GW of offshore wind. Indonesia is an ideal location for tidal power, because of strong ocean currents that move between the world’s largest archipelago’s thousands of islands. The Larantuka Strait between Flores and Adonara is one such area, with a number of sites now being considered by the Indonesian government. The Palmerah Tidal Bridge is also being trumpeted as a way of improving grid connectivity in the eastern part of Indonesia, and giving people in the area better access to education, healthcare and job opportunities. The project has been awarded to Tidal Bridge BV, a joint venture between Dutch engineering firm Strukton International and venture capital fund Dutch Expansion Capital. It is slated to be completed by 2019 at a cost of US$550 million. The companies behind the project claim Palmerah Tidal Bridge will be the largest tidal power facility in the world. However, South Korea’s Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station, with power output of 254 MW, has around double the capacity of the Palmerah project, as does the Rance Tidal Power Station in France, with power capacity of 240 MW. Greenpeace Indonesia climate and energy campaigner Hindun Mulaika told Eco-Business that the organisation supported the development of renewable energy in Indonesia, a country that is a big coal extractor and user, and continues to approve plans to build new coal-fired power plants to meet its growing energy demands. Around 50 million Indonesians are without reliable electricity, and president Joko Widowo’s 35,000 MW plan to electrify the country is slated to use mostly coal (20,000 MW, or 57 per cent) to deliver power to those without it. A report by Greenpeace released in January predicted that if plans to build new coal power plants go ahead in Indonesia, it will suffer more deaths as a result of air pollution than any country in Southeast Asia. Hindun said that the group “supports the development of renewable energy to foster the transition away from huge coal dependencies in the country.” “We found a perfect example in Palmerah Tidal Power Plant where the energy source can be found in local resources, which will surely cut distribution costs that commonly occur in big centralised power plants,” she noted. “But for any renewable project that is developed in Indonesia, it needs to be based on comprehensive research, in this case fish passage design for the tidal bridge and power plant development for the mitigation measures,” she said. “The project design and its implementation should consider and ensure it does not harm the environment and biodiversity, particularly marine mammals, turtles and whale sharks and their ecosystems,” added Hindun, stressing that the environmental assessment of this project should also take into account migration routes of fish and other marine mammals.  The tidal plant should also allow fishermen to pass through the straight easily, and consideration is also needed for the potentially increased sedimentation above and below the dams, so as not to impact local fisheries, she said. Eric van den Eijnden, chief executive officer, Tidal Bridge, told Eco-Business that research had been done to assess the environmental impact of the bridge on biodiversity in the area, and that the consequences would be “very limited”. He said that water speed would decrease as a result of the bridge, but this has “no known” environmental consequences. Eco-Business has requested for Tidal Bridge BV to share the results of its research, including the likely impact on local communities. The company has yet to produce its findings.  Van den Eijnden added that fish mortality at the hands of the massive turbines that power the plant would be “negligible” because the turbines are “fish-friendly”— designed to prevent fish from being crushed when they pass through it. Van den Eijnden added: “[Local] fishermen are very enthusiastic because we respect the shipping lanes and they can use the electricity to build cool cells. With this [electricity], they are able to freeze the catch and are thus able to build up a proper industry.”  Tidal power has proved to be controversial in Korea, home of the world’s largest tidal power plants, despite the technology’s renewable status. Environmental groups and fishermen in Korea have predicted that large tidal power plants will bring about deep and lasting harm to tidal ecosystems, fisheries and the landscape. They have also complained about a lack of environmental impact studies to investigate the potential impact of tidal power plants.

But there may now be a solution to the problem and it involves zapping autumn litter into oblivion with lasers. Dutch rail company Nederlandse Spoorwegen has revealed it is working with the Delft University of Technology and a British inventor to fit powerful lasers under two of its trains to burn away leaves from the tracks.  Scroll down for video  Falling leaves from trees beside railway tracks led to 4.5 million hours of passenger delays last year, so rail operators hope a new laser system will help them clear the dangerous leafy mulch that builds up on rails The technology will use intense beams of infrared light to vaporise the build up of material on the rails before the wheels of the train passes over them. Fallen leaves cause delays on the rail network because they can cover and stick to the tracks when wet. This can make the tracks slippery in itself, but the problem becomes worse when heavy metal train wheels pass over the top, as the leaves get sucked under the wheels and crushed, compacting the material into a hard, shiny substance that has been compared to Teflon. When this layer becomes wet, the tracks become excessively slippery and braking distances can double. Once stationary, trains can also struggle to get going again as they are unable to get traction on the tracks. Leaf mulch can also insulate train wheels from the rails, meaning signallers get less information about the location of trains on the network, meaning trains need to run with bigger spaces between them. Yet despite this, leaves on the line remains the excuse most likely to infuriate train travellers each autumn as they struggle to understand why rail companies cannot be better prepared for this problem. The perennial excuse of fallen leaves causing travel chaos has long been seen as a running joke, but according to Network Rail in the UK, leaves caused 4.5 million hours of passenger delays in 2013. The laser device sits just in front of the wheels while a specially designed suspension system helps to keep the high powered beam focused on the layer of mulch that builds up on rails as leaves get wet and break down Methods including brushing and grinding the rails, washing with jets of water or ice have all been tried, but with limited success. Now researchers at Delft University of Technology have been developing a system with the Dutch rail engineering firm Strukton Rail, the national network ProRail and train operator Nederlandse Spoorwegen. ‘We are now investigating whether offers laser solution,’ Jurjen Hendriks, one of the researchers at Delft University of Technology told the website Kennislink. The Laser Railhead Cleaner (LRC) which has been installed by the researchers on a Nederlandse Spoorwegen DM-90 train, sits under the train just in front of the wheels. Most current methods for removing mulch from train tracks use high powered jets of water to wash the rails The device uses a Nd:YAG laser to pulses of laser light with a wavelength of around 1,064 nanometres, which is infrared. According to experts the wavelength used is specifically absorbed by the leaves and other organic matter that can build up on the tracks, but not by metal. This means that the energy from the lasers is reflected off the rails without damaging them while the leaf material is vaporised, a process known as ablation. A spokesman for Strukton Rail said: ‘The LRC briefly heats the organic material on the rails and because the organic material expands more rapidly it separates from the rails. The Laser Railhead Cleaner system is being trialed underneath Nederlandse Spoorwegen DM-90 trains Lasers can be used to detect when fruits like apples, bananas, pears and tomatoes reach their 'peak' for eating. Researchers from Saint Joseph University in Lebanon and the Université de Bretagne Occidentale de Brest in France have developed a technique that looks at the speckling of the skin of fruits. As climacteric fruits like apples and bananas mature and ripen on the tree, it is important to pick them at exactly the right moment. After this point the fruit becomes vulnerable to fungi or starts to rot. The researchers found they could analyse the speckle patterns on the skin of Golden apples as they ripened by looking at the way the laser light was scattered and reflected from apple skin. This changed as the fruit ripened. The researchers hope the technique can be used to help farmers pick their fruit at exactly the right time. ‘What’s more, rust bursts away as well. The rails are cleaned and dried as a result, preventing any other material from adhering to them for some time. ‘Tests have shown that because they are solid, rails and other infrastructural objects are not damaged by the ablation process.’ The Laser Railhead Cleaner technology was first invented by a former Royal Navy Officer called Malcolm Higgins, who has developed the technology under the company name LaserThor. Tests on his technology between 1999 and 2004 were conducted by RailTrack and its predecessor Network Rail but revealed that it struggled to focus the laser correctly on the track due to vibrations as the trains picked up speed. However, Mr Higgins proved that dirt and moisture were vaporised from the track at speeds just over 6mph. He later teamed up with the German Fraunhofer institute in Aachen and the Rofin Sinar laser firm in Hamburg to develop a more powerful laser. This used a two kilowatts of infrared laser light that produced 25,000 pulses per second. This heated the leafy mulch to temperatures of more than 5,000 degrees, causing it to vanish from the rails. Further tests with Network Rail showed it was successful at speaks of up to 40mph, but Network Rail said it chose not to take the tests further. Mr Higgins has now been working with Strukton Rail and Delft University as a consultant on the project. They have been able to improve the system so that it can clean 20mm of rail head on both sides of the track at speeds of up to 50mph. Their device also uses a suspension system to help protect the optics of the laser from vibrations while the laser also temporarily switches off if it misses its target. Instead of lasers, Network rail said it is now concentrating on using high pressure jet washing technology to bash away leaf mulch and laying down a composite of sand and aluminium onto the tracks to aid traction. The laser is focused onto the rail head so that pulses of intense light vaporise any organic material that has built up on the surface of the tracks This year Network Rail has also begun using new technology called a tribometer, a handheld device that accurately measures how slippery the rails are, on its network in Merseyside. Data from this device is then used to assess the effectiveness of treatments and whether more are needed, according to the company. But lasers also have advantages as sand and water tanks need to be regularly refilled while water jets can damage the rails. They claim their laser is so precise it can etch a diagram into the head of a match without setting it alight.  Professor Rolf Dollevoet, who is leading the new trials at Delft University of Technology, said: ‘The question is not so much whether the laser system works, but for how long the rails will remain clean. ‘We’ll measure the remaining friction over time during rain, drizzle, frost and snowfall. ‘From these measurements NS and Prorail can derive at what frequency the 6,000km of track need to be lasered and how many trains have to be equipped with lasers to achieve that.’ Share what you think The comments below have been moderated in advance.

That there is some friction every now and then should not spoil the fun. The important thing is that both sides recognize the importance of stable relations. From the Surinamese side, it is in any case recognized that there is an advantage to be gained. The Dutch business community can make a substantial contribution to the development of Suriname. The Strukton company does this on a large scale with projects in the field of energy and railway development. The Dutch banking system finances several major projects. The Surinamese diaspora and tourism are also good reasons for healthy relationships. That's right, doing business with criminals is certainly not wrong.

More than seventeen megawatts were saved in one day and the head of state thanks society for that. “People have understood what it is all about,” said Bouterse in the radio program Bakana Tori. The savings far exceed expectations.” I had thought after our call that we would save four to five megawatts. But our people have proven that they understand what it's all about,” says Bouterse. The direct result is that the shortage of energy has almost been eliminated. Bauxite company Suralco had already promised to supply an additional twenty megawatts from the Afobakka power station. With the cuts, energy company EBS is now almost able to cover the need. The shortage was caused by the sudden shortening of the delivery. EBS does have a new diesel power plant with extra energy and Staatsolie also supplies tens of megawatts. The problem is that the infrastructure is not meant to handle more load.

Recent events give rise to doubts about Sanderink’s ability to make rational decisions.” The Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal is unprecedentedly harsh on Thursday in its judgment on Centric CEO Gerard Sanderink. The IT service provider had drawn this along in the private quarrel that he had been fighting with his ex-girlfriend Brigitte van Egten for several years. And that was sufficient reason to grant the request of the Public Prosecution Service to immediately suspend Sanderink as director of Centric. He must also at least temporarily transfer his shares in the company to an external manager. According to the Enterprise Chamber, the public interest is being damaged too much by the lawsuits that Sanderink and Van Egten have been conducting back and forth for three and a half years. By instructing Centric to start a case against his ex-girlfriend earlier this year, Sanderink involved a company that performs crucial functions for governments, among others, in his private perils. The 2,500 employees in the Netherlands also suffer from the resulting loss of customers. “The recruitment of new staff is stalling, Centric’s Dutch activities have now become loss-making,” the Enterprise Chamber motivated its decision. “This poses an acute threat to the company. There is good reason to doubt the correctness of the policy pursued at Centric.” Two weeks ago, the Public Prosecution Service asked the Enterprise Chamber for further investigation into possible mismanagement at Centric after Sanderink had reappointed himself as CEO of the company. At the beginning of 2021, he had just left because of the unrest that had arisen. The case is unprecedented in the Netherlands. Rarely did the Public Prosecution Service start proceedings at the Enterprise Chamber to start an investigation into mismanagement at such a large company (turnover 2021: 422 million euros, approximately 3,800 employees). The request arose from a longer-running investigation by the justice system itself into the state of affairs at the company. The Public Prosecution Service was concerned that the continuity of the company’s services for customers (such as governments) and employees would be jeopardized if it did not intervene. Centric has not been doing well for a long time. Since Sanderink got into a relationship with the self-proclaimed and controversial cyber expert Rian van Rijbroek in 2018, several drivers had to leave or resigned themselves. Those involved have repeatedly outlined to NRC, among others, that Van Rijbroek’s involvement in the company had to do with this. She would make important decisions in the background and also draft emails on behalf of Sanderink. Read more about the key players in the Sanderink case here: Will Gerard Sanderink be forced to resign from Centric? Sanderink also fought and lost several legal battles with his ex-girlfriend, Brigitte van Egten, since the beginning of 2019. The entrepreneur has accused her for years of fraud at one of his companies, solar panel manufacturer DSS, where she was director. She would also have put terabytes of porn on that company’s server. The judge has never found any evidence for the various allegations. Sanderink now has to pay Van Egten for millions in penalty payments. Sanderink left little doubt on Thursday about who is to blame for his suspension: his ex-girlfriend and the media. “I made this company great. I got Strukton on track, I got Antea [Group] helped out,” he said, referring to other companies in his empire. “And now I can do that again. But I am being killed by negative reporting.” According to Sanderink and his lawyer Paul Acda, there is nothing wrong with Centric. When Acda gives his speech during the session on Thursday, it will only be about the negative way in which Sanderink would have been portrayed in the media for pages. Until the chairman of the Enterprise Chamber intervenes. “Mr. Acda, this case is about Centric. The first place in your defense that mentions that company is on page 5.” The immediate reason for the preliminary investigation that the Public Prosecution Service launched into Centric at the beginning of this summer was a seizure by the company at Van Egten. Centric claimed to have lost tens of millions of euros due to Sanderink’s ex-girlfriend. Customers would have walked away because of the negative publicity that all the legal battles have entailed. The IT company therefore had an attachment for 1.96 million euros from Van Egten. Coincidentally, that was exactly the amount that Sanderink had outstanding from his ex-girlfriend in previous lawsuits in penalties still to be paid. The judge therefore made short shrift of the attachment and accused Centric of abuse of law. This led to the resignation of several Centric directors who no longer wanted to be used for Sanderink’s private whims. Also read how the soap around Centric started: How the Automater Was Bewitched by the Cyber ​​Guru The Public Prosecution Service wanted to see how the unrest around Centric could be removed. According to the judiciary, which spoke to several former executives, the automation company is now in the red due to the high costs of hiring external staff and recruiting new customers. According to Sanderink, hiring external staff is necessary to “serve customers with specific knowledge that Centric does not have in-house”. To ward off the unrest, Centric itself wanted to expand the powers of its own works council (OR). He or she could also investigate abuses within the company itself. The condition was that Sanderink would not return as director. The works council and all directors of Centric outside Sanderink had already agreed to this. However, the option was blocked by the entrepreneur himself. He returned to the company shortly afterwards, after which several directors resigned. The only remaining member of the board – non-executive board member Peter Mous – was suspended by Sanderink on Wednesday afternoon after it turned out that he would support the request of the Public Prosecution Service. The works council itself was incredibly fierce about his owner on Thursday. “Customers want a supplier of impeccable conduct. Not a top executive who just throws all kinds of conspiracies into the world. It is extremely annoying that customers who are satisfied with the service still cancel contracts because they no longer want to be associated with Centric.” Sanderink himself did not want to hear it all. He said it was clear who should lead the company. Although there may be a director appointed by the Enterprise Chamber next to him who “does not have the deciding vote”. “You have seen that I can cause a turn-around in companies. I have the power and strength to get companies back on their feet.” And: “But will I get support from the judicial system? No. My mouth is being gagged. It would be nice if you would support us today by rejecting this request for suspension.” That support was not forthcoming on Thursday.

The automation company announced last Wednesday that Sanderink, at the age of 74, will once again be in charge of the company that he set up in 1992 and of which he is still wholly owner. Also read: The Public Prosecution Service is reaching for a heavy means to depose Gerard Sanderink Sanderink’s companies (besides Centric, among others, infrastructure builder Strukton) have been restless for years because of the many changes at the top and the private legal conflicts that the entrepreneur is fighting with his ex-girlfriend. Those involved previously spoke in NRC about the important role that Sanderink’s current girlfriend – the controversial and self-proclaimed cyber expert Rian van Rijbroek – plays. It would, among other things, encourage the departure of several directors. Board members also became frustrated with her involvement in the companies. One of the reasons that the Public Prosecution Service is involved in the case is that many governments are customers of Centric. The Enterprise Chamber must now consider measures that are necessary to ‘guarantee the stability and continuity of Centric’. One of the questions that the Enterprise Chamber must now answer is whether there are reasons to conduct further investigation into the state of affairs at the IT company. At the same time, the Enterprise Section can impose temporary measures as long as the investigation is ongoing. Sanderink may then be temporarily suspended. In a second phase of the procedure, the Enterprise Section must consider whether there has been mismanagement at Centric. The appointed investigators have then completed their report with findings. If mismanagement is established, the Enterprise Section may decide to permanently remove Sanderink from his position as director. The voting rights that the Twente entrepreneur has as owner and with which he is concerned with the appointment of a new director may also be withdrawn.

We have specialists with the experience and knowledge to dismantle a drug lab safely and professionally. In addition, we have the right material and we can realize ADR transport. Drug dumping and drug labs are a common problem in the south of the Netherlands and are also becoming more frequent in other parts of the Netherlands. The source of the drug waste is a drug laboratory, the place where the production of drugs and the formation of the drug waste takes place. In almost all cases, the locations where the drug lab is located are highly contaminated with hazardous chemicals. For example, mercury chloride is used in the production of Crystal Meth. Mercury is a volatile substance which can cause serious contamination. This contamination can cause short and long-term damage to humans, animals and the environment. It also happens that drug labs are found on agricultural sites. The drug waste can then be dumped in manure cellars. Strukton Milieutechniek is immediately available to rid such manure pits of manure with drug waste or, in the worst case, drug waste with manure. After the clearing, we like to think along about a follow-up approach. Because walls and soil are polluted, a manure cellar can ""evaporate"" for a long time, with consequences for the immediate environment. We have specialists with the experience and knowledge to dismantle a drug lab safely and professionally. When dismantling a drug laboratory, it is important to check whether the soil is contaminated. Strukton Milieutechniek is also a soil specialist and is the right partner for clearing up drug laboratories for complete restoration of the crime scene in accordance with laws and regulations. Thanks to our extensive experience, we can immediately assist in clearing the drug waste after an evacuation of a drug laboratory. Because we have a unique environmentally licensed location and ADR transport, we can ensure the acceptance of the drug waste. We use our own waste flow numbers, then report it to the National Waste Reporting Center and then forward it to an accredited processor. Cleaning manure cellars can be extra difficult because manure grids can collapse. Even after cleaning, the manure cellar can continue to 'evaporate'. If this is the case, Strukton Milieutechniek can clean the air with its own 'air washing installation'. Strukton Milieutechniek offers advice, support and is available 24/7.

Lees hier de shownotes van het eerste seizoen van 'Achter Gesloten Deuren'. De dag dat alles veranderde. Een schets van de topman en zijn imperium. Wie is Gerard Sanderink als persoon en zakenman? U maakt kennis met ex-vriendin en hoofdrolspeler Brigitte van Egten. De ondernemer en de meesterhacker. Wat gebeurt er wanneer vriendin en omstreden cyberexpert Rian van Rijbroek ten tonele verschijnt? De bedrijven en de miljoenenerfenis. Deze aflevering staat stil bij de gevolgen voor bouwer Strukton en IT-bedrijf Centric. En hoe zit het met het vermogen en de opvolging van Sanderink? De boerenzoon en de Saoedische prins. Deze staat helemaal in het teken van Strukton. Wat is er aan de hand bij de spoorwegbouwer? Het begin van het einde. Je hoort over de onrust die uitbrak bij Centric toen Gerard Sanderink zijn IT-bedrijf meesleepte in een rechtszaak tegen zijn ex-vriendin Brigitte van Egten. Buitenspel. In deze nemen we je mee de rechtszaal in. Je hoort hoe Gerard Sanderink de macht kwijtraakt over zijn eigen IT-bedrijf Centric. Spotify Apple Podcasts Google Podcasts RSS Hoofdpersoon van deze podcastserie. Gerard Sanderink (Weerselo, 1948) richtte in 1978 samen met zijn toenmalige compagnon Hans Quellhorst het bedrijf ICT Automatisering op, dat later uitgroeide tot ICT Group. Maar toen was de Twent al voor zichzelf begonnen. Met deze Sanderink Groep, dat sinds 2000 verderging onder de naam Centric, groeide hij uit tot een van de grootste ICT-aanbieders. Met klanten waar je u tegen zegt, zoals De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), de Sociale Verzekeringsbank (SVB) en 80% van de Nederlandse gemeenten. In 2005 nam Sanderink ingenieursbureau Oranjewoud over. Samen met verschillende buitenlandse bedrijven doopte hij het om tot Antea Groep. Vijf jaar later volgde de overname van bouwbedrijf Strukton. Beide bedrijven werden ondergebracht in het beursgenoteerde Oranjewoud. Aan die beursnotering kwam op 7 februari 2022 een einde. Sanderink is een rijk man. Al sinds 2002 staat hij in de Quote 500. Vorig jaar werd zijn vermogen geschat op €550 mln, goed voor de 82e plek in de jaarlijkse rijkenlijst. Kinderen heeft hij niet, wel een vriendin (Rian van Rijbroek) en een ex (Brigitte van Egten). Wat er met zijn vermogen gebeurt als Sanderink overlijdt, weet alleen Van Rijbroek. Over zelfverklaard cyberexpert Rian van Rijbroek (Veghel, 1969) is maar weinig bekend. In 2018 raakte ze in opspraak na een uitzending van Nieuwsuur, waarin ze de 'smart blockchain' introduceerde. Al tijdens de uitzending maakten deskundigen gehakt van haar analyse. Enkele dagen later volgde Nieuwsuur met excuses. Ze had toen al met oud-minister Willem Vermeend van De wereld van Cybersecurity en Cybercrime geschreven. Dat boek bevatte inhoudelijke onjuistheden en plagiaat, waarna het uit de handel werd genomen. In 2019 volgde Unhacked, dat ook door beveiligingsexperts met de grond gelijk werd gemaakt. Op een YouTube-filmpje uit 2012 is ze in verleidelijke poses te zien als fotomodel in een zevensterrenhotel in Dubai. Dat modellenwerk was eigenlijk een dekmantel voor een geheime missie voor een inlichtingendienst, beweerde ze tegenover De Telegraaf. Ook liet ze doorschemeren voor de AIVD te hebben gewerkt, maar dat bleek niet zo te zijn. Toch is Sanderink erg gecharmeerd van Van Rijbroek. Zo erg zelfs dat hij zijn vriendin Brigitte van Egten inruilt voor Van Rijbroek. Ook mag de Veghelse als penningmeester zijn nalatenschap beheren. Niet lang na de start van hun relatie beginnen de beschuldigingen van fraude aan het adres van Van Egten. De ex van Sanderink is misschien nog wel mysterieuzer. Brigitte van Egten (Den Haag, 1954) geeft nooit interviews, wel heeft ze een LinkedIn-profiel. Daar is te lezen dat ze haar carrière begon als gerechtssecretaris bij de rechtbank Zutphen om daarna aan de slag te gaan als docent rechten aan de Hogeschool Enschede (nu Saxion). Aan haar juridische loopbaan kwam in 2003 een einde toen ze een relatie kreeg met Sanderink en hij haar vroeg zijn zonnepanelenbedrijf Dutch Solar Systems (DSS) te leiden. Ze zou er tot tot mei 2019 directeur blijven, een half jaar na de breuk. Volgens Van Egten allemaal de schuld van Van Rijbroek, die Sanderink met complottheorieën voedt. De multimiljonair verdenkt zijn ex van onder meer 'fraude', 'diefstal' en 'seks met Afrikanen'. Ook zou Van Egten ervoor gezorgd hebben dat de Fiscale inlichtingen- en opsporingsdienst (Fiod) zijn bouwbedrijf Strukton met 'grote overmacht' binnenviel voor een onderzoek naar betaling van steekpenningen in Saoedi-Arabië. Het conflict heeft al tot tientallen rechtszaken geleid, met beslagleggingen over en weer. Aan de ene kant vecht Van Egten haar ontslag en de smaadcampagne aan, aan de andere kant proberen Sanderink en zijn bedrijven de gederfde omzet te verhalen op Van Egten. Veel van die zaken lopen nog. Gerard Sanderink en Rian van Rijbroek geven via hun advocaat Paul Acda de volgende reactie: ‘Gerard Sanderink en Rian van Rijbroek wensen niet te antwoorden op uw vragen. Sinds begin 2021 heeft de heer Sanderink in het geheel niet meer gereageerd in de media. De heer Sanderink constateert dat de procedures door de wederpartij steeds weer opnieuw onder de aandacht worden gebracht bij de media of dat er nieuwe procedures worden gestart die gebaseerd zijn op omstandigheden uit 2019. Dit steeds met het enkele doel om de heer Sanderink, diens bedrijven en de mensen om hem heen te beschadigen. Mevrouw Van Rijbroek heeft in het geheel geen aandeel gehad in de zaken maar ook zij is doelbewust betrokken door de wederpartij om Van Rijbroek, Sanderink en diens bedrijven te beschadigen. Zeer recent — op 29 maart 2022 — is de heer Sanderink volledig vrijgesproken van smaad jegens mevrouw Van Egten. Reeds eerder had het Openbaar Ministerie de strafrechtelijke aantijging van laster al laten vallen. Voorts zijn er ook binnen de andere procedures thans ontwikkelingen die Sanderink met vertrouwen tegemoet ziet en die een compleet ander beeld zullen geven over de zaken waarin de heer Sanderink en mevrouw Van Rijbroek ongewenst in betrokken zijn geraakt. In het belang van deze ontwikkelingen zullen zij derhalve geen verder commentaar geven.' Centric heeft laten weten niet te willen reageren op de vragen die het FD ze heeft gesteld. Ze wijzen op een eerder interview dat met hun ceo en cfo is verschenen. In een reactie aan het FD laat Strukton weten dat de Fiod-inval in februari 2019 gebaseerd is op verdenking van corruptie en valsheid in geschrifte bij het verkrijgen van een opdracht voor het metroproject in Riyad. Het bedrijf geeft aan compleet verrast te zijn door de inval en volledige medewerking te hebben verleend aan het onderzoek. Ook heeft Strukton een intern onderzoek uitgevoerd. Volgens Strukton zijn er geen concrete aanwijzingen voor onregelmatigheden of omstandigheden die tot een Fiod-inval zouden kunnen leiden. 'Dat blijkt ook uit de documenten die het Openbaar Ministerie tot nu toe heeft verschaft.' Strukton hoopt dat het Fiod-onderzoek zo snel mogelijk wordt afgerond en dat de bevindingen met het bedrijf gedeeld worden. Tot op heden is er in dit dossier nog geen aanklacht tegen Strukton ingediend. Het bedrijf wil niet ingaan op het verzet van Gerard Sanderink tijdens de beslaglegging op zijn mailbox. Over zijn terugtreden na beslaglegging en het heraantreden dat daarop volgde zegt Strukton Sanderink dankbaar te zijn voor de tijd die hij in het bedrijf steekt. Naar eigen zeggen zijn ze in stabieler vaarwater gekomen 'door een versterkte governance en een verbeterde financiele situatie'. De reden voor het vertrek van toenmalig ceo Erik Hermsen wil Strukton niet geven. Wel laat het bedrijf weten in 2021 gestart te zijn met het veranderen van de structuur van Stukton Groep. In dat jaar is de directie ook uitgebreid. Naast een ceo en een cfo zijn er ook functies op het gebied van reporting, finance, legal en HR bijgekomen. Strukton betreurt alle commotie die rond de persoon Gerard Sanderink is ontstaan. Zij zijn van mening dat Gerard Sanderink veelvuldig in een kwaad daglicht is gesteld. Dit raakt ook het bedrijf omdat hij aandeelhouder en bestuurder is. Ondanks de gebeurtenissen wil het bedrijf 'dagelijks doen waar ze goed in zijn: samen met opdrachtgevers en ketenpartners zorgdragen voor duurzame infrastructuur'. 'Strukton ontkent met klem zich schuldig te hebben gemaakt aan enig strafbaar feit. Strukton is niet betrokken geweest bij ambtelijke omkoping in KSA en heeft voorts geen valsheid in geschrifte gepleegd jegens Atradius. Na de plotselinge inval door de FIOD in februari 2019 heeft Strukton lange tijd moeten wachten op de onderbouwing van de verdenking, opgenomen in het strafdossier. Nu inmiddels het strafdossier is ontvangen, is hierin duidelijk geworden dat de verdenking van het O.M. voornamelijk is gebaseerd op eigen vermoedens en aannames, zonder dat hier een deugdelijk objectief feitenonderzoek aan ten grondslag ligt. Voorts is uit bestudering van het strafdossier gebleken dat belangrijke getuigen niet door de FIOD zijn gehoord in het onderzoek. Op verzoek van Strukton worden deze getuigen nu wel gehoord bij de onafhankelijke onderzoeksrechter van de rechtbank Amsterdam en kan Strukton haar verdedigingsrechten maximaal inzetten tegen de onjuiste aantijgingen vanuit het Openbaar Ministerie. In het belang van dit onderzoek wenst Strukton thans geen verdere duiding te geven op concrete stukken. Ten aanzien van de zaak aangaande Atradius wenst Strukton te benadrukken dat naast het aanvraagformulier van de EKV er ook veelvuldig contactmomenten en correspondentie is geweest tussen Strukton en Atradius en dat hierin alle belangrijke factoren zijn benoemd, waaronder veelvuldig het percentage van 2,5 % van de aanneemsom als totale vergoeding van de door Strukton in KSA ingeschakelde agent. Ook is Atradius veelvuldig middels diverse documenten geïnformeerd over belangrijke aspecten aangaande de aanvraag EKV. In de visie van Strukton heeft Atradius hierom ook – met een volledige kennis van zaken – de EKV goedgekeurd en naar het Ministerie verzonden. Voorts is in 2017 door Atradius uitgebreid onderzoek gedaan naar de achtergronden van de bedragen op de EKV. Uitkomst van dit onderzoek was o.a. dat Strukton het voordeel van de twijfel behoorde te krijgen omtrent de vraag of er sprake was van opzettelijk handelen. Ook is door Atradius destijds geoordeeld dat de EKV evengoed afgegeven zou zijn bij het hebben van alle naderhand bekend geworden informatie omtrent de agentvergoeding. Dat het OM binnen het onderzoek na de inval van februari 2019 nu tot een andere beoordeling van de feiten komt, verbaast Strukton – in het licht van de afdoening in 2017 door Atradius / de Staat - ten zeerste. In de overtuiging van Strukton zal na een volledig en objectief onderzoek naar de feiten de conclusie voortkomen – net als reeds uit eerdere interne onderzoeken door diverse accountantskantoren is gebleken – dat Strukton geen enkel strafrechtelijk verwijt valt te maken. De heer Gerard Sanderink sluit zich aan bij deze reactie van Strukton. Aanvullend wenst hij ten aanzien van zijn eigen rol te benadrukken dat eerlijkheid een kernwaarde is in zijn bestaan en hij hierom nimmer betrokkenheid zou hebben bij zaken die hem nu verweten worden. De inval door de FIOD in 2019 en de onterechte aantijgingen jegens hemzelf en Strukton raken hem hierom in hevige mate.' 'Laat voorop staan dat wij, samen met de Nederlandse overheid, geen transacties willen ondersteunen die op oneigenlijke wijze tot stand zijn gekomen of op wat voor manier dan ook te linken zijn aan ontoelaatbare praktijken tegen mens, dier en milieu. Als op basis van due diligence de conclusie is dat het risico hierop te hoog is, kan er geen verzekering worden afgegeven. Hiertoe voeren wij altijd een uitgebreide risicobeoordeling uit. Wij hebben een strikt anti-omkopingsbeleid gebaseerd op Nederlandse en internationale standaarden (OECD Recommendation of the Council on Bribery and Officially Supported Export Credits) en vragen aan de exporteurs om ook een anti-omkopingsverklaring te ondertekenen. Voor behandeling van elke aanvraag is de informatie die aan ons verstrekt wordt door de verzekerde altijd leidend. Dat is ook zo vastgelegd in onze algemene voorwaarden. Zo dienen exporteurs tijdens het acceptatieproces te verklaren dat de aangeleverde informatie juist en volledig is. Daarnaast maken wij ook gebruik van eigen bronnen voor het signaleren van onder andere sancties, corruptie en fraude. In veel gevallen krijgen we hierbij ook hulp van ambassades en externe consultants. Als de door de verzekerde aangeleverde informatie achteraf onjuist of onvolledig blijkt te zijn dan kan dat leiden tot een vertekend beeld van de risico’s die wij beoordelen. Indien zich een dergelijke situatie voordoet, beoordelen wij welke impact dat heeft voor die specifieke zaak en welke gevolgen wij daaraan verbinden, zoals bijvoorbeeld sancties onder de verzekeringsovereenkomst. Recentelijk is ons anti-omkopingsbeleid geëvalueerd door een externe consultant. De onderzoekers concluderen dat er een aanzet tot verscherpt beleid is gedaan en dat het belang van een effectief anti-omkopingsbeleid breed wordt erkend. Desalniettemin vergt het huidige omkopingsbeleid nadere uitwerking en zijn er uit de evaluatie concrete aanbevelingen naar voren gekomen. Wij werken intensief samen met onze opdrachtgever, de Nederlandse Staat, om daar verder invulling aan te geven.' Het Openbaar Ministerie laat in een reactie aan het FD weten dat zij geen inhoudelijke mededelingen doen over de aanleiding van het onderzoek. Ook kan het OM op dit moment nog niets zeggen over de verdenkingen dan wel de verdachten. Het onderzoek bevindt zich op dit moment in de regiefase. Het OM geeft aan dat ze verwachten de zaak in 2023/2024 voor de rechter te brengen. Via hun advocaten Paul Acda en Gino van Tilborg heeft het FD Gerard Sanderink en Rian van Rijbroek benaderd voor commentaar. Hierop kwam geen reactie. In een reactie op vragen van het FD geeft Centric aan niet in te kunnen gaan op vragen over specifieke klanten. Volgens het bedrijf heeft de aanstelling van het nieuwe bestuur door de Ondernemingskamer rust gebracht onder klanten en biedt het de mogelijkheid voor een nieuw toekomstperspectief. Het nieuwe bestuur wil zorgen voor rust en stabiliteit binnen het bedrijf. Daarnaast heeft het behoud van klanten de hoogste prioriteit. Het nieuwe bestuur is direct begonnen met kennismakingen en het bijwonen van business updates. Daarbij viel hen grote drive en loyaliteit van medewerkers op. Op situaties en gebeurtenissen die zijn voorgevallen onder vorige besturen kan het nieuwe bestuur niet ingaan. Dat geldt ook voor de afwezigheid van de advocaten van Centric, tijdens de zitting bij de Ondernemingskamer. Ook doet Centric geen uitspraak over eventuele toekomstige procedures. Via hun advocaten Paul Acda en Gino van Tilborg heeft het FD Gerard Sanderink en Rian van Rijbroek benaderd voor commentaar. Hierop kwam geen reactie. In zijn verklaring bij het OM heeft Sanderink laten vastleggen dat hij 'geen invloed heeft gehad' op de beslissingen van het Centric-bestuur ten aanzien van de dagvaarding van Van Egten. Ook zegt hij niet te weten wie de opdracht gaf beslag te leggen bij zijn ex-geliefde. Dat de rechter heeft geoordeeld dat Centric in deze kwestie 'misbruik van recht' heeft gemaakt, vindt Sanderink 'nergens op slaan'. Centric geeft nogmaals aan dat ze geen uitspraak doen over lopende procedures. Ook geven ze aan dat het door de Ondernemingskamer benoemde bestuur in deze periode niet betrokken was bij Centric en dus niet kan reageren. De advocaat beroept zich op zijn geheimhoudingsplicht: 'Ik kan u enkel mededelen dat ik een reactie op een eventuele klacht kenbaar zal maken in de daarvoor bestemde procedure.' Johan Taams: 'Helaas ben ik juridisch gebonden en kan ik niet inhoudelijk reageren op de zaak. Graag wil ik benadrukken dat ik altijd zuiver heb gehandeld in het belang van Centric, haar medewerkers en klanten. Dat wil ik nu ook doen.' Aike Schoots: 'Ik wilde u laten weten “géén commentaar” te hebben omtrent uw bericht.' Sinds de komst van Rian van Rijbroek in 2018 en het begin van alle rechtszaken tussen Gerard Sanderink en Brigitte van Egten schreef het FD enkele tientallen artikelen. Lees hier onze beste stukken.

Other participants in the consortium, led by Spain’s FCC, are France’s Alstom and Setec, South Korea’s Samsung, Freyssinet Saudi Arabia and Typsa, also of Spain. Strukton’s share of the Arriyadh Development Authority project, which includes 63.8 km (40 miles) of tracks and 26 stations, is worth roughly $1 billion, the company said. Financial crime prosecutors said in a statement that they had searched the offices of Strukton International BV and Strukton Civiele Projecten BV. It was not immediately clear if the investigation included other companies. “The focus of the investigation is possible corruption and forgery in relation to the obtaining of a contract to build a metro in Riyadh,” a statement said. Documents were seized at several locations on Friday, it said. Strukton confirmed on Friday that searches were underway and said it was cooperating. Prosecutors said the investigation was part of efforts to clamp down on bribery of bureaucrats by Dutch businesses abroad.

This concerns an amount of up to 200,000 euros. In three cases, all of which occurred in Brabant, the cabinet has adopted a more generous attitude. The entire remediation operation is hereby reimbursed: Faton Bajrami, lawyer for the nineties: “I call it a wasp. The letter to parliament does indeed state that two hundred thousand will be released, but at the end it can also be read that governments such as the province and municipality must continue their attempts to recover the damage from the perpetrator. It is a gesture for the stage,"" the Breda lawyer clarifies. ""I understand through the grapevine that the municipality of Zundert is sticking to its intention to pass on the costs to my client. She has already seized his house. B and W maintain that he is responsible for the dumping, even if experts prove otherwise.” Urgently requested In the meantime, Bajrami is of course not sitting still either. He had already initiated proceedings before the Council of State. The lawyer wants to challenge the decision of the mayor and aldermen of Zundert to have Francken pay for the costs. This week he will urgently urge the highest judicial body in our country. He will also request documents from the municipality that would show that Strukton Militeutechniek already concluded at the end of April 2020 that the contamination had originated in a ditch and therefore outside Francken's plot. It would also have been established that the contamination had spread via the ditch and the groundwater under the piece of land belonging to his client. The counselor will also ask BIJ12 for clarification. This nationally operating organization supervises the implementation of the subsidy scheme for the clearance of drug waste. Bajrami: “So extra money is set aside for cleaning up drugs from people like my client. Then it seems that you are innocent, but in practice I have serious doubts about the legal feasibility. Why else would the municipality stand firm like that?” Things are not going well with FranckenIncidentally, Francken hardly gets any of the discussion about the drug waste that was partly found on his territory. His (mental) health has taken a turn for the worse, partly due to the persistent accusations made by the municipality. Bajrami hopes to keep him out of the wind as much as possible. With new developments, he mainly has contact with his daughter. The municipality of Zundert confirms that it will recover the costs from Francken as the owner of the plot on Pater Taksweg. According to her, the drug discharge can be attributed to him, according to soil investigations. A spokesperson could not yet say when the soil remediation would begin. He also says that the municipality is pleased with the news that the government wants to think along and is willing to offer tailor-made financial solutions in this matter.

Among other things, she adheres to a report from a witness who saw a white box truck driving around a quarter to ten on Sunday evening near a parking lot on Anconalaan. A liquid was leaking from this closed truck and a pungent chemical smell was said to be coming from it. The police strongly suspect that this vehicle was involved in the dumping. 'Busy days for Strukton'The waste was in three IBC Containers, which are large barrels with a volume of approximately one thousand litres. After part of the rubbish was discharged into the parking lot, the perpetrators continued until halfway along the service road along Eindhovenseweg, between Eindhoven and Son. This is where the containers were left behind. Claereboets: ""These are busy days for us. Yesterday we had to clean up such a container in Nuenen. Now again in Eindhoven. It is unbelievable that this is happening more and more in the neighborhood where people live."" The mess ended up on the service road and in the verge. A single sealing cap, hydrochloric acid and stench reminded us of the dumping in the early afternoon on Monday. Most of the road had to be closed for the cleanup. Claereboets: ""It takes a lot of effort to clean up everything safely and responsibly."" For example, a special transport had to be used to pump over the contents of the barrels that were not yet empty. The job will cost ten to twenty thousand euros, estimates Claereboets. Damage to the sewer seems to be not too bad. According to the police, part of the polluted area must be excavated and the sewer will also have to be cleaned. A spokeswoman for De Dommel Water Board reports that the damage to the sewer system seems to be not too bad. ""There is so much water flowing through it that the water treatment plant will not be affected despite the horrible stuff. The sewer may have to be flushed with a thinner,"" she said. As a precaution, the water board was warned of possible damage on Sunday evening. Exactly what kind of rubbish it is is still being investigated. Specialists are conducting a trace investigation. 'Dumped from car before' The junk was dumped from a car or other vehicle. A spokesman for the police: ""There are more examples of dumping from moving vehicles, at least it looked very similar given the way the waste was found."" Mayor John Jorritsma of the municipality of Eindhoven reacted furiously: “This is yet another proof of the brutality and nonchalance of XTC criminals. It is unacceptable and very harmful. It undermines our society: nature, public health and safety and also our wallet, because municipalities are responsible for the clean-up costs. That is why we work closely with the police, Public Prosecution Service, Tax and Customs Administration, FIOD and other government services to tackle crime. Because every dumping is one too many. Perhaps festival-goers who use a pill can also realize this.”READ ALSO: Drug waste dumped from moving car, hydrochloric acid ends up in roadsides and sewersMore frequent hit in Eindhoven-NoordIt is the third drug bust in Eindhoven-Noord in a relatively short time.

24,https://nos.nl/l/2378180,2021-04-25,nos.nl,Newspaper/Magazine,,1,"Police are puzzled: where is the drug waste? Hanneke de Jonge Hanneke de Jonge The police are puzzled: last year more drug laboratories were dismantled than the year before, but less dumped drug waste was found than expected. Big question: where does that waste go? The images of leaking barrels and jerry cans dumped in a forest, ditch or along the road are well known. Manufacturers of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy and crystal meth easily discharge the chemical waste into nature. Two years ago this happened almost 300 times, last year that number had dropped by more than 100 dumping. While the number of drug labs found rose by a quarter. According to Max Daniel, Drugs portfolio holder of the National Police, one of the explanations is that the police receive reports more often when vans are driving around in a nature reserve. ""You can no longer do that in good conscience, because then you run the risk that walkers - and there are now a lot of them - call and say: could this possibly be a dumping?"" Daniel does not have the impression that fewer drugs are being produced in the Netherlands. ""We see in all labs that we find, and there are more and more, that they are becoming more professional with faster procedures and larger boilers where larger quantities of drugs are made."" It is inevitable that criminals get rid of their waste in a smarter way,"" he says. An example of such a smart way is the 'drug pit' that was found last March in the Brabant woods near Bergen op Zoom by forest ranger Erik de Jonge. He found a covered well on a hill of sandy soil where drug waste has probably been discharged for years. ""We have never seen this before, I don't think it has ever been found in the Netherlands. But we had been afraid for a while that we would find this."" Forest ranger Erik de Jonge would rather have seen that the waste was 'just' dumped in jerry cans. ""They stand out, then you are often there in time . This well is a disaster."" He suspects that the remediation of the soil could cost hundreds of thousands of euros. But rapid action is also important with a classic dumping. Leaking barrels pose a direct threat to the environment and public health. Leon van Zoggel in action. As a Dangerous Substances expert at Strukton, he and 24 colleagues are responsible for clearing up the chemical mess. They are ready day and night. They recently had a major job in Asten in Brabant. There was 1700 liters of drug waste dumped on a country road ""I assume a lorry drove into this and tipped its load. And that is why the barrels have opened,"" says Van Zoggel. But he also sees this type of dumping decreasing. Where does it go? Van Zoggel suspects that it mainly disappears in manure cellars. ""At the beginning of this year, we cleared three locations where the manure cellar of drug waste had been dumped. If you consider: rural area, there is no supervision, there is no social control, it is so easy to pull the lid off the draw pit where the farmer gets his slurry and then let your stuff run in there, a quick action"" , explains Van Zoggel. The police are also aware that this is happening. ""We regularly receive signals like this that farmers have been approached. We cannot exclude that there are people who are forced to do this and feel pressure from the criminal organization to make their space available. And there will probably be a few who turn a blind eye because it suits them financially,"" Daniel thinks. ""We don't have a complete view of where the drug waste ends up. We also have signals that it is disappearing abroad, for example, where there is less supervision of the environment."" But the police do not have hard evidence. And then there is the sewer. That is discharged into it, researchers from the KWR Water Research Institute have shown. They tested the sewage water of the Eindhoven region every day for three years, for three months. The large quantities we find can never be the result of use, these are traces of waste,"" says researcher Thomas ter Laak. Would it help the police if there were a national investigation? ""That would indeed help. Combined with tips and our own information, it would certainly help us in the investigation,"" said Max Daniel. Nieuwsuur Binnenland Share article:",0.9965,25,22
25,https://www.hengelo.nl/Welkom-in-Hengelo/Beheer/Nieuwsoverzicht/Kruispunt-Deldenerstraat-Marskant-weer-open.html,2022-05-25,www.hengelo.nl,Newspaper/Magazine,Crossroads Deldenerstraat Marskant open againhtml,1,"Kruispunt Deldenerstraat – Marskant weer open! Op 10 mei 2021 werd deze belangrijke kruising afgesloten. Een nieuwe inrichting voor de Deldenerstraat (vanaf de Langestraat tot aan de kruising Tuindorpstraat (inclusief Mitchamplein) en Marskant volgde. Iets meer dan een jaar later is de volledige kruising heringericht én weer open. Wethouder Gerard Gerrits is blij met de afronding van de vernieuwing van de Deldenerstraat: ‘Werkzaamheden aan een belangrijke invalsweg hebben veel impact in de stad. Ik ben blij met het begrip én geduld wat we de afgelopen jaren van onze inwoners hebben gekregen’. Want met het openen van de kruising komt er een einde aan een groot herinrichtingsproject in de Hengelose binnenstad. Dat project startte in 2019 met een nieuwe inrichting voor het deel tussen kruispunt Bornsestraat tot aan de Langestraat. In 2020 volgde het deel tussen de kruising Tuindorpstraat en kruising Geerdinksweg. De herinrichting van de Marskant, Deldenerstraat én de kruising rondom het Mitchamplein was de laatste horde. Door een prettige samenwerking met aannemer Strukton Civiel én gunstige omstandigheden is het project sneller afgerond dan oorspronkelijk de bedoeling was. Boven de grond is de herinrichting van het gebied duidelijk zichtbaar. Langs de Marskant en het Mitchamplein is de F35 doorgetrokken. Op de Bankastraat na ligt er nu door heel Hengelo een mooie veilige fietsverbinding. Ook zijn beide weghelften wat versmald, wat snel rijden ontmoedigt. Auto- en fietsverkeer heeft een eigen plek gekregen, zo veilig mogelijk voor alle partijen. Gerrits: ‘verkeersveiligheid is in ons beleid één van de speerpunten, de automobilist, fietser én voetganger hebben een eigen plek en dat bevordert de verkeersveiligheid’. Naast een verkeersveilige inrichting is het nieuwe ontwerp ook gericht op een efficiënte doorstroming voor alle verkeersdeelnemers. Nieuwe intelligente verkeerslichten zorgen voor efficiënte afwikkeling van het verkeer. Gerrits: ‘Mooi dat dit nu gerealiseerd is langs de gehele Deldenerstraat. Zo langzamerhand zien we die intelligente systemen op steeds meer plekken in de stad en dat komt de afwikkeling van alle verkeersstromen zeker ten goede!’ In het afgelopen jaar is ook veel werk verricht waar nu niets meer van te zien is. Onder de grond is het vuilwaterriool vernieuwd. Daarnaast is er een nieuw regenwaterriool aangelegd. Dit riool zorgt voor de afvoer van regenwater naar de Berflobeek. Dus geen schoon regenwater meer naar de rioolwaterzuivering maar afvoer via de natuurlijke manier: de beek. Klimaatadaptatie is dan ook een belangrijk onderdeel in dit project. Belangrijke wegen moeten toegankelijk blijven tijdens flinke hoosbuien. Door de rioolstelsels van elkaar te scheiden wordt het water op deze plek tijdens piekbuien beter afgevoerd. Verkeer heeft er op deze manier zo weinig mogelijk last van. In het hele gebied is ook meer ruimte gecreëerd voor groen. Het Mitchamplein heeft de parkeerfunctie behouden maar is flink vergroend. Ook langs de wegen zijn diverse plantvakken aangelegd. Aannemer Strukton Civiel zorgt de komende weken nog voor een finishing touch van het gebied. Het verkeer zal hier geen hinder meer van ondervinden. Nieuw toegangsbeleid Hengelose binnenstad Het bestaande toegangsbeleid voor de Hengelose binnenstad voldoet niet meer. Dat is de conclusie van uitgebreid onderzoek naar het verkeer en het gedrag van verkeersgebruikers in de binnenstad. Uit het onderzoek komt het rapport ‘Advies actualisatie toegangsbeleid binnenstad Hengelo’ voort. In dit rapport worden de maatregelen geadviseerd die de binnenstad weer autovrij moeten maken. Het college heeft ingestemd met het verder uitwerken en aanpassen van het toegangsbeleid zoals beschreven in het adviesrapport. Mobiliteitsplan: Heel Hengelo in beweging Hengelo is volop in beweging. We willen meer en betaalbare woningen bouwen. En onze economische positie als technologische topregio versterken. Dat betekent meer inwoners, meer bedrijvigheid en daarmee ook meer verplaatsingen. Daarom is er de afgelopen maanden hard gewerkt aan een mobiliteitsplan voor Hengelo. Wethouder Hanneke Steen is blij met het resultaat: ‘De titel ‘Heel Hengelo in beweging’ zegt het al, er gebeurt een hoop in onze mooie gemeente. En om de leefbaarheid, verkeersveiligheid en bereikbaarheid in Hengelo in de toekomst goed te houden, moeten we keuzes maken. Dat doen we in het mobiliteitsplan.’ Samenwerkende Twentse gemeenten sluiten contract met Vattenfall voor de levering van aardgas De Samenwerkende Twentse Gemeenten (DSTG) Borne, Enschede, Dinkelland, Haaksbergen, Hellendoorn, Hengelo, Hof van Twente, Losser, Oldenzaal, Tubbergen, Wierden en een aantal partners krijgen met ingang van 1 januari 2023 het aardgas dat ze verbruiken geleverd door Vattenfall. Drie gemeenten - Enschede, Hof van Twente en Losser - tekenden bovendien een overeenkomst met Twence voor de levering van groengas: een belangrijke bijdrage aan de duurzaamheidsdoelstellingen van zowel Twence als de gemeenten. Energiekrediet voor Hengelose bedrijven De gemeente Hengelo biedt een kredietmogelijkheid aan voor Hengelose bedrijven die door gestegen energielasten in de problemen komen. Deze kredietmogelijkheid geldt tijdelijk totdat de landelijke regeling ‘Tegemoetkoming Energie Kosten’ (TEK) van kracht wordt. Vraag van de maand Elke laatste dinsdag van de maand leest u hier over een kwestie waar veel mensen over belden naar de gemeente. Of waarover ze informatie zochten op deze site. Deze keer: Hengelose bushaltes worden aangepakt De komende maanden vernieuwt de provincie Overijssel de borden met reisinformatie bij bushaltes in de gemeente Hengelo. De nieuwe digitale informatieborden zijn moderner en een stuk energiezuiniger dan de oude. Op de digitale borden staat hoe laat de bussen vertrekken, informatie over vertragingen, omleidingen en alternatieve routes. De verwachting is dat de werkzaamheden aan de haltes eind juni 2023 zijn afgerond. College stelt bijna half miljoen beschikbaar voor zonneveld Boeldershoek De komst van een zonneveld in de Boeldershoek is weer een stap dichterbij. Het college van B en W wil een zogenoemd voorbereidingskrediet beschikbaar stellen van €489.120,-. De gemeenteraad moet dit bedrag nog goedkeuren. Het geld komt beschikbaar voor de netaansluiting, het opstellen van een plan en ontwerp voor de ontwikkeling en exploitatie van het zonneveld, aanvullend onderzoek en het participatietraject. Hengelo ontvangt van Rijksoverheid subsidie van € 15 miljoen Hengelo heeft vandaag vanuit Meerjarenprogramma Infrastructuur, Ruimte en Transport (MIRT) een subsidie van maar liefst € 15 miljoen ontvangen. De subsidie is bestemd voor de versnelde bouw van in totaal 1500 woningen in de binnenstad en Hart van Zuid. Om die versnelling te realiseren moeten nieuwe woningbouwlocaties goed bereikbaar zijn. Speciaal daarvoor heeft het Rijk het MIRT-programma in het leven geroepen. Twente Board blij met impuls van 30 miljoen euro voor spoorlijn Zwolle-Twente-Münster Twente Board is blij met de toezegging van het Rijk van 30 miljoen euro voor de treinverbinding Zwolle-Twente-Münster. Dit is van doorslaggevende betekenis voor het voortbestaan van deze spoorverbinding met onze Oosterburen. En dat is hard nodig, want alleen al tussen Enschede en Münster reizen dagelijks ruim tienduizend mensen op en neer. Wat gaat de gemeente doen in 2023? De Hengelose gemeenteraad heeft ingestemd met de Beleidsbegroting 2023 – 2026. Met daarin ruimte en ambitie voor nieuwe investeringen in de stad. Hengelo zoekt Junior Cyber Agents Een smartphone, laptop en/of tablet zijn niet meer weg te denken. Even snel wat opzoeken op Google of een Instagram story maken, we zijn er de hele dag mee bezig!

De gemeente Hengelo nodigt u van harte uit voor het Open Huis op zaterdag 26 november van 10.00 tot 16.00 uur. Oekraïners langer in woningen Nijverheid De Oekraïense vluchtelingen die tijdelijk in de woningen van Welbions in de Nijverheid wonen, kunnen daar enkele maanden langer blijven. Welbions stelt de werkzaamheden voor de sloop en vervolgens nieuwbouw van de betreffende woningen in de Nijverheid uit tot na de zomervakantie van 2023. De reden hiervoor is de lange levertijd van de benodigde bouwmaterialen voor de nieuwbouw en het tekort aan personeel in de bouw. Aandacht voor Week van de Pleegzorg Soms zijn er omstandigheden waardoor een kind (tijdelijk) niet kan terugvallen op een veilige thuisomgeving. Gelukkig zijn er in Hengelo veel mensen die iets voor een ander willen betekenen, zoals pleegouders. Dat zijn vrijwilligers die een kind van een ander in hun huis én hart opnemen, tijdelijk of langer. En dat is hard nodig! Elk jaar zijn er veel nieuwe pleeggezinnen nodig. De gemeente is heel blij met de bijna 80 Hengelose pleeggezinnen. Daarom biedt de gemeente alle pleeggezinnen een cadeaukaart aan. College stemt in met omgevingsvisie ‘Hart van Hengelo’ Het college van B en W heeft op 11 oktober ingestemd met de omgevingsvisie ‘Hart van Hengelo’. Deze visie gaat over de Binnenstad en Hart van Zuid. Het college stelt de gemeenteraad voor om de omgevingsvisie vast te stellen. Vraag van de maand Elke laatste dinsdag van de maand leest u hier over een kwestie waar veel mensen over belden naar de gemeente. Of waarover ze informatie zochten op deze site. Gemeente zet duizenden lichten uit Op zaterdagavond 29 oktober is het van 20.00 tot 21.00 uur pikkedonker in de stad. De gemeente zet dan duizenden openbare lichtpunten uit. Aanleiding is de jaarlijkse Nacht van de Nacht. Op deze avond vragen verschillende organisaties en instellingen aandacht voor lichtvervuiling en energiebesparing. In de bibliotheek zijn op deze avond activiteiten in het donker. Verlichte tocht Licht in het donker en Allerzielenviering Nabestaanden kunnen hun dierbaren gedenken tijdens twee gezamenlijke herdenkingsbijeenkomsten. Op woensdag 26 oktober is er een verlichte tocht over het begraaf- en gedenkpark aan de Oldenzaalsestraat. Op zondag 6 november is de Allerzielenviering op het begraaf- en gedenkpark aan de Deurningerstraat. Bladruimen start 24 oktober Het is herfst, de tijd van vallende bladeren en mooie kiekjes. De gevallen bladeren kunnen soms ook zorgen voor gevaarlijke situaties bijvoorbeeld op straten en fietspaden. Daarom starten Gildebor en groenaannemers vanaf maandag 24 oktober met het verwijderen van bladeren in de openbare ruimte. Door de warme en droge zomer is dat een weekje eerder dan u gewend bent. Lambertusbasiliek op zwart voor duurzaamheidscampagne Op maandagavond 17 oktober blijft de Lambertusbasiliek donker. Op deze manier wil de gemeente Hengelo aandacht vragen voor de lancering van de landelijke campagne ‘Zet ook de knop om’. Deze campagne is in het leven geroepen om mensen te helpen met energie besparen. Wolfkaterweg in beeld voor woningbouw De gemeente Hengelo heeft met twee grondeigenaren een optieovereenkomst gesloten om twee percelen grond aan te kopen aan de Wofkaterweg in Beckum. De gemeente is met onder meer de Dorpsraad Bruisend Beckum de mogelijkheden aan het onderzoeken om woningen te bouwen in en rondom Beckum. Dat is nodig voor de leefbaarheid in Beckum.

Met de certificering wordt nog duidelijker wat voor belangrijke schakel Het Taalpunt is. Coming Out Dag: 11 oktober 2022 Dinsdag 11 oktober is het internationale Coming Out Dag. Dit is de dag waarop we wereldwijd stilstaan bij het uit-de-kast-komen van lhbti's en queer-personen. Dit is nog lang niet voor iedereen vanzelfsprekend. Hengelo hangt dan de Progressvlag uit, de opvolger van de regenboogvlag. Als symbool dat iedereen erbij hoort in Hengelo. Investeren in de toekomst ondanks onzekere tijden Het college van B en W biedt een structureel sluitende Beleidsbegroting 2023-2026 aan de gemeenteraad aan. Met daarin ruimte en ambitie voor nieuwe investeringen in de stad, ondanks onzekere gemeentefinanciën op de lange termijn.

Vluchtelingen Nijverheid naar Hazenweg Begin volgend jaar verandert er iets voor de Oekraïense vluchtelingen die nu verblijven in de woningen van Welbions in de Nijverheid. Zij verhuizen in februari 2023 naar de bestaande opvanglocatie aan de Hazenweg. De vluchtelingen en de omwonenden van de Hazenweg zijn daar afgelopen weekend over geïnformeerd. Week tegen Eenzaamheid Van 29 september tot en met 6 oktober is het de Week tegen Eenzaamheid. Ook u kunt vandaag iets betekenen voor iemand die zich eenzaam voelt. Hebt u een familielid, vriend of buur die hier last van heeft? Er is altijd wel iets dat iemand leuk vindt om te doen, samen met u of met anderen. Een steuntje in de rug kan veel betekenen. Duurzaamheidsmarkt bij stadhuis Op zaterdag 8 oktober staat er op het plein voor het stadhuis een grote duurzaamheidsmarkt. Belangstellenden kunnen hier bij verschillende kraampjes terecht voor alles wat met duurzaamheid te maken heeft. De wooncoaches van Hengelo Energie zijn bijvoorbeeld aanwezig om advies te geven over isoleren en besparen, maar ook over de aanschaf van een warmtepomp of zonnepanelen. Gemeente zet veteranen weer in het zonnetje Op zaterdag 24 september zet Hengelo voor de 14e keer de Hengelose veteranen in het zonnetje. Zo’n 135 veteranen reageerden op de uitnodiging van burgemeester Sander Schelberg en komen naar de Hengelose Veteranendag.

Er wordt gestart aan de Weideweg, vanaf 17 oktober is de Oldenzaalsestraat aan de beurt. Het verkeer kan, met enige hinder, gebruik blijven maken van de kruispunten. Zilveren Erepenning voor Wijkcentrum ’t Lansink Op donderdag 1 september reikte wethouder Marie-José Luttikholt de zilveren Erepenning uit aan de voorzitter van het Wijkcentrum ’t Lansink, de heer Jan Willem Korenromp. Dit ter ere van het 100-jarig jubileum bij Wijkcentrum. Hengelo ontvangt van ministerie van EZK subsidie van € 4,8 miljoen Vandaag heeft het ministerie van Economische Zaken en Klimaat (EZK) bekend gemaakt een subsidie van € 4,8 miljoen aan Hengelo te verstrekken. De subsidie komt voort uit het programma Impulsaanpak Winkelgebieden (IW). Het is bestemd voor de herinrichting van het gebied achter het voormalige V&D pand. Het gaat om de locatie tussen de Marskant en de Beekstraat. Dit gebied wordt getransformeerd van winkelgebied naar woongebied. Lambertuskermis allereerste kermis zonder uitstoot van fossiele brandstof Een primeur op de Hengelose Lambertuskermis dit jaar! Van 14 tot en met 18 september draaien alle attracties op accustroom. Dit betekent dat de attracties voor het eerst niet aangedreven worden door een dieselaggregaat; een unicum. Nog niet eerder heeft een kermis in Nederland volledig gedraaid op accustroom. Winkelcentrum Slangenbeek bijna 700 m2 groen rijker In het voorjaar van 2021 won de vergroening van het Winkelcentrum Slangenbeek de stemronde voor Van Grijs naar Groen in Slangenbeek. Bijna 700 vierkante meter verharding in het winkelcentrum is vergroend. Een prachtig resultaat! En er gebeurt nog veel meer! 30 nieuwe inwoners in de opvanglocatie aan de Hazenweg Dinsdagavond 12 juli hebben dertig nieuwe inwoners intrek genomen in de vluchtelingenopvanglocatie aan de Hazenweg. Het gaat om kinderen met hun moeders en enkele vaders, van diverse nationaliteiten. Veiligheidsregio Twente heeft samen met de veertien Twentse gemeenten toegezegd om voor 225 noodplekken en dus extra opvang te zorgen om de locatie in Ter Apel te ontlasten. Wooncoaches klaar om Hengeloërs te helpen met verduurzamen De gemeente Hengelo en Coöperatie Hengelo Energie willen huiseigenaren stimuleren om hun woningen te verduurzamen. Dat houdt in dat de wooncoaches adviezen gaan geven hoe Hengeloërs energie kunnen besparen door bijvoorbeeld hun woning goed te isoleren, maar ook hoe ze zelf energie kunnen opwekken met bijvoorbeeld zonnepanelen; de meest groene energie is immers de energie die niet gebruikt hoeft de worden. Ook moet deze aanpak armoede als gevolg van hoge energielasten tegengaan. 200 tijdelijke huurwoningen in Groot Driene Voor jongeren, studenten en spoedzoekers is het momenteel moeilijk om betaalbare en geschikte woonruimte te vinden. Gemeente Hengelo, woningcorporatie Welbions en ontwikkelcombinatie Leyten-Trebbe slaan de handen ineen om snel enige verlichting op de woningmarkt te brengen. Het resultaat is dat er 200 tijdelijke huurwoningen worden geplaatst op de voormalige ROC-locatie aan de Sportlaan Driene in Hengelo. Reset van sociaal domein Het college van B en W windt er geen doekjes om; het sociale domein van de gemeente Hengelo moet grondig veranderen en wel nu. IKEA opent nieuwe zonnecarports met meer dan 3400 zonnepanelen IKEA Hengelo heeft 3.460 zonnepanelen geplaatst op de parkeerplaats. De vestiging heeft extra oppervlakte voor de panelen gecreëerd met zogenoemde zonnecarports boven de parkeerplaatsen. De zonnepanelen van IKEA Hengelo wekken 1.8 megawattpiek per jaar op. Strategische agenda voor gezonde toekomst Het college van B en W wil de komende jaren samen met de gemeenteraad, inwoners en partners bouwen aan een strategische agenda voor de toekomst. Zodat er geld beschikbaar is en blijft om te investeren in de stad, juist daar waar dat het hardste nodig is. Het college stelt de raad voor om deze agenda binnen een jaar op te stellen. In de Zomerbrief geeft het college een eerste aanzet voor de strategische koers. De gemeenteraad bespreekt de Zomerbrief op 12 juli tijdens een politieke markt. Intrekkingsbesluit 'noodverordening boerenprotest Twence' De toegangswegen naar de afvalverbrandingsinstallatie van Twence waren geblokkeerd. Politieke Markt Vanavond in het stadhuis Bus en aanhanger met ‘drugsvaten’ zorgt voor meldingen van Twentse inwoners De afgelopen weken heeft op verschillende plekken in Twente een bus en aanhanger vol met ‘drugsvaten’ en materialen voor de productie van drugs gestaan. Met deze actie vragen politie en gemeenten in Twente aandacht voor het thema drugscriminaliteit en werd er gekeken in hoeverre inwoners bereid zijn een verdachte situatie te melden. Dit leverde een wisselend beeld op. SchouwArt mag podium voor beeldende kunst vormgeven Hengelo is weer een stap dichterbij een permanent podium voor beeldende kunst. Vernieuwde Elsbeek feestelijk geopend Op donderdag 23 juni werd de vernieuwde Elsbeek in Hengelo officieel geopend.

Woninginbraak: Je zou het maar meemaken Stel je voor. Na en dag werken, ga je nog even samen met de hond op bezoek bij familie. Rond 17.00 uur ga je weg en twee uur later word je gebeld door de buurvrouw ‘volgens mij is er ingebroken bij jou’. In paniek rijd je naar huis en wat je daar aantreft, blijft je tot op de dag van vandaag bij. Tweede omgevingsvisie ter inzage De wereld om ons heen verandert snel. Op hetzelfde moment spelen diverse grote trends op het gebied van demografie, technologie en klimaat. Deze leiden in ons land tot een aantal grote ruimtelijke opgaven. De komst van online winkelen zet centrumgebieden onder druk, de inwoners en behoeftes veranderen, er is een grote vraag naar woningen en we hebben samen een grote duurzaamheidsopgave. Met de omgevingsvisie wordt ingespeeld op deze maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen en wordt er richting gegeven aan de toekomstbestendige stad. De visie ligt tot en met 26 juli ter inzage en op 23 juni is er een informatieavond in de stadhuishal. Een exclusief interview met Special Olympics-atleten Friso Roeleveld en Sanne Droste!

Kruispunt Deldenerstraat – Marskant weer open! Op woensdag 25 mei is het kruispunt Deldenerstraat weer open voor alle verkeer. Op 10 mei 2021 werd deze belangrijke kruising afgesloten. Een nieuwe inrichting voor de Deldenerstraat (vanaf de Langestraat tot aan de kruising Tuindorpstraat (inclusief Mitchamplein) en Marskant volgde. Iets meer dan een jaar later is de volledige kruising heringericht én weer open. Wethouder Gerard Gerrits is blij met de afronding van de vernieuwing van de Deldenerstraat: ‘Werkzaamheden aan een belangrijke invalsweg hebben veel impact in de stad.

Scholen uit Hengelo, Twenterand en Berkelland strijden tegen textielafval De Textiel Race is een initiatief van Knol Recycling. Het project is officieel van start gegaan met een kick-off met Wethouder Bas van Wakeren op de Wilbertschool. Positieve waardering binnenstad blijft De waardering voor de binnenstad handhaaft zich op een stabiel niveau. Sinds 2019 stijgt de waardering voor de binnenstad na jarenlange afname. Dit blijkt uit de jaarlijkse binnenstadspeiling onder leden van het Hengelopanel in 2021. Aan de ondervraagden zijn elf te waarderen aspecten voorgelegd. Ten opzichte van 2020 is er meer variatie in de waardering te zien. De positieve waardering van de sfeer en ‘de binnenstad in het algemeen’ is licht gestegen. Opvallend deze keer is toename van de waardering voor het ‘groen’ en de daling voor ‘de kwaliteit van het winkelaanbod’. Alleen folders in de bus met Ja-sticker Vanaf 1 juni 2022 geldt in Hengelo de Ja-sticker. U ontvangt dan alleen reclamefolders als u een Ja-sticker op uw brievenbus plakt. Doet u niets, dan krijgt u geen reclamefolders. Met de Ja-sticker wil de gemeente papierverspilling verminderen. Een gemiddeld huishouden ontvangt per jaar zo’n 26 kilo reclamedrukwerk. Een groot deel hiervan belandt ongelezen bij het oud papier.

Op de vooravond daarvan, op woensdag 4 mei, worden ook in Hengelo de slachtoffers herdacht die in Nederland of waar ook ter wereld zijn omgekomen of vermoord sinds het uitbreken van de Tweede Wereldoorlog, in oorlogssituaties en bij vredesoperaties. Daarom wordt om 20.00 uur twee minuten stilte in acht genomen. Bij het herdenkingsmonument voor het stadhuis worden kransen gelegd. € 145.000 voor vernieuwing en versterking culturele programmering Afgelopen winter moesten veel culturele instellingen de deuren weer sluiten door de lockdown. Nu er weer van alles mag, is het voor de culturele sector belangrijk dat ze nieuwe activiteiten kunnen organiseren. De omvang van budgetten is vaak beperkt, waardoor nieuwe activiteiten opzetten niet mogelijk is of een te groot risico is. Het Rijk heeft daarom subsidie beschikbaar gesteld om de culturele sector te ondersteunen. Gemeente Hengelo zet daarvan € 145.000 in zodat de culturele sector kan investeren voor de lange termijn en zorgen dat er weer innovatie plaats kan vinden in de sector. Lintjesregen in Hengelo Op dinsdag 26 april reikt burgemeester Sander Schelberg zes Koninklijke Onderscheidingen uit aan Hengeloërs die zich jarenlang vrijwillig inzetten voor de maatschappij. Dit gebeurt tijdens een bijeenkomst in de Burgerzaal in het stadhuis tussen 10.00 en 12.00 uur. Herinrichting: Nieuwstraat en eerste deel Brinkstraat afgerond Al een aantal maanden is aannemer Dusseldorp druk bezig met de werkzaamheden in het kernwinkelgebied en op het marktplein. De eerste winkelstraten zijn inmiddels ingericht tonen hun nieuwe gezicht graag aan de stad. Duurzaamheidsroute A35 kan energie opwekken voor 25.000 huishoudens De Duurzaamheidsroute A35 kan naar verwachting minimaal 75 GWh tot maximaal 100 GWh aan energie opwekken. Dat is genoeg voor zo’n 25.000 tot 35.000 huishoudens in Twente. Dat blijkt uit een verkenningsrapport van verschillende samenwerkingspartners in Twente. Uit de verkenning blijkt dat de grond langs de A35 en een deel van de A1 geschikt is voor zonnevelden. De Hengelose Beren logeren tijdelijk ergens anders Vanaf februari is aannemer Dusseldorp druk bezig met de werkzaamheden op het marktplein. De beren hebben vanwege de overlast van de werkzaamheden hun koffers gepakt en zijn op zoek gegaan naar een tijdelijk onderkomen. Maar het marktplein blijft hun thuis. Na de oplevering van het vernieuwde plein krijgen ze een mooie plek in de vijver bij de Brinktoren. Nieuwe tijdelijke invulling in voormalige MTS De komende periode ontstaat er weer meer levendigheid in de voormalige Hofstede MTS aan het Industrieplein. Oplevering Informatieverslag Informateur Stefan Kuks heeft woensdagavond 13 april zijn informatieverslag gepresenteerd aan de gemeenteraad. Bestrijding eikenprocessierups weer van start De eerste eikenprocessierupsen zijn op 8 april weer uit het ei gekropen. Dat betekent dat de preventieve bestrijding van de rups weer gaat beginnen. Als de weersomstandigheden meezitten start dit op 13 april. Gildebor komt de komende weken tussen 19.00 en 02.30 uur twee keer langs om alle zomereiken te bespuiten met aaltjes. Waar kwamen al die kindergeluiden vandaan? Een heleboel kinderen waren het! Met heel veel enthousiasme. Het nieuwe Actieplan ’22-’26 staat voor een sfeervolle en levendige binnenstad Het Actieplan voor een vitale Hengelose binnenstad voor 2022-2026 is realistisch en net zo ambitieus als het Actieplan 2017-2021. Vrijwel alle ambities uit het vorige Actieplan zijn gerealiseerd of in gang gezet. In de periode 2022-2026 verschuift de focus geleidelijk naar de rand van de binnenstad. Het gaat hierbij vooral om de aanloopstraten en transformatie naar wonen en werken van gebieden in het centrum maar buiten het compacte hart van binnenstad. De omgevingsvisie Binnenstad-Hart van Zuid en de ontwikkeling van de spoorzone Hengelo-Enschede bieden kansen en uitdagingen voor de verdere ontwikkeling van de binnenstad in de komende jaren. Een groot en belangrijk onderdeel is de verdere uitwerking en realisatie van het plan Lange Wemen. Stadscompliment De Nijverbij voor de heer Marinus van Rooij Als blijk van dank voor zijn vrijwillige inzet Netwerk van laadpalen in de hele stad De gemeente Hengelo heeft een kaart gemaakt waar alle bestaande en toekomstige laadpalen op staan in Hengelo. Hulp voor gedupeerde ouders van de toeslagenaffaire Bent u in de problemen gekomen door de toeslagenaffaire van de kinderopvang? Dan kan de gemeente u helpen. Koper voor historische villa Markant Het plan van investeerder Hephaistos-Skapa is als winnaar uit de bus gekomen bij de verkoopprocedure van villa Markant. Verbod gebruik lachgas in binnenstad Het recreatief gebruik van lachgas op een openbare plaats in combinatie met overlast of een verstoring van de openbare orde is in de gehele gemeente Hengelo al geruime tijd verboden. Nu gaat er op 30 maart een algemeen gebruiksverbod in waarbij lachgas in de gehele binnenstad wordt verboden. De boete voor het gebruik van lachgas in de binnenstad bedraagt €100. Tegemoetkoming bij veel medisch afval Hengeloërs met veel medisch afval, zoals stomamateriaal, incontinentiemateriaal en dialysemateriaal, maken vaker gebruik van de ondergrondse container of laten vaker hun zorgcontainer legen. Daarom vergoedt de gemeente een deel van de afvalkosten die zij maken. De vergoeding van dit jaar bedraagt maximaal 135,20 euro en kan vanaf 1 mei 2022 worden aangevraagd bij de gemeente Hengelo. Regeling Energietoeslag bekend Huishoudens met een laag inkomen in Hengelo kunnen vanaf maandag 9 mei de eenmalige Energietoeslag van 1300 euro aanvragen. Het formulier is te vinden op www.hengelo.nl/energietoeslag. Mensen met een laag inkomen die al bekend zijn bij de gemeente krijgen het geld automatisch over gemaakt. Zij hoeven geen aanvraag in te dienen. Koninklijke onderscheidingen en raadspenningen De heer Jos Rikkerink en de heer Ilhan Çetinkaya krijgen een Koninklijke onderscheiding opgespeld door burgemeester Sander Schelberg. Ook reikt de burgemeester meerdere raadspenningen uit. Dat gebeurt tijdens het afscheid van de raadsleden van de raadsperiode 2018-2022 op dinsdag 29 maart om ongeveer 19.30 uur in de raadzaal in het stadhuis van Hengelo. Maandag 4 april om 12.00 uur test luchtalarm Herken jij een drugslab of hennepkwekerij?! Op zolders, in kelders, in schuren of tuinhuisjes, in bedrijfspanden of op boerderijen: de productie van drugs komt overal voor. In Twente ontdekt de politie elk jaar bijvoorbeeld ruim tweehonderd hennepkwekerijen. Ook worden er steeds vaker drugslabs ontdekt. En dat kan dus zomaar bij u in de buurt zijn. Informatiefase van start BurgerBelangen heeft Stefan Kuks bereid gevonden om de rol van informateur op zich te nemen. Minder maaien voor meer biodiversiteit De Hengelose gemeenteraad heeft gekozen voor ecologisch maaibeheer. Dat betekent dat we op veel plekken van kort gemaaide gazons naar kruidenrijke bermen en grasstroken gaan. Gildebor gaat, vanaf dit voorjaar, op veel plekken anders maaien dan u gewend bent. Dit alles om het evenwicht in de natuur terug te brengen, want de biodiversiteit staat onder druk. Bijdrage aan culturele organisaties Veel culturele instellingen zijn vanaf de zomer van 2021 weer activiteiten gaan organiseren, met het idee dat er in het najaar weer van alles mogelijk zou zijn. Door een nieuwe coronagolf nam het Rijk echter vanaf 28 november weer maatregelen. Daardoor konden veel activiteiten toch niet doorgaan. Het rijk heeft door middel van een nieuw steunpakket een bijdrage beschikbaar gesteld voor 2022 ter ondersteuning van de lokale culturele infrastructuur. Met resterende middelen van 2021 is er daardoor voor 2022 € 839.573 beschikbaar. Hengelo wil het geld op twee manieren inzetten. Ten eerste door financiële risico’s van culturele organisaties te compenseren en ten tweede door geld beschikbaar te stellen om activiteiten door te kunnen laten gaan in coronatijd (versterken en vernieuwen lokale culturele programmering). Hengelo vangt Oekraïense vluchtelingen op Ook de gemeente Hengelo gaat vluchtelingen opvangen. Op korte termijn gaat Welbions woningen aan de Mariastraat, Wilderinksstraat, Krabbenbosweg en Geerdinksweg beschikbaar stellen voor Oekraïense vluchtelingen. NK Tegelwippen ook in Hengelo van start Hengelo is dit jaar een van de gaststeden van het NK Tegelwippen 2022. Het NK, dat op 21 maart van start gaat en duurt tot en met 31 oktober, wordt in zeker 100 Nederlandse gemeenten georganiseerd. Het doel? Vervang zoveel mogelijk (tuin)tegels door groen! Betaalbare huurappartementen in ‘oude’ MTS Ontwikkelaar VincentSpikker wil op korte termijn circa 50 studio’s / tweekamerappartementen realiseren in de voormalige Hofstede MTS, in het deel aan de Trijpstraat. Hengelo op zwart tijdens Earth Hour Op zaterdagavond 26 maart om 20.30 uur dooft Hengelo de lichten in de gemeente tijdens het wereldwijde Earth Hour. Landelijk ‘Dag van de Solidariteit' Zaterdag 12 maart is het landelijk ‘Dag van de Solidariteit’. Die dag is er van 16.00 tot 18.00 uur een bijeenkomst in het Kulturhus Hasselo voor Oekraïners in Twente (zowel vluchtelingen als Oekraïense mensen die hier al langer wonen), gastouders van Oekraïense vluchtelingen en mensen die overwegen om gastouder te worden. Subsidie presentatie beeldende kunst De gemeenteraad heeft op 9 maart € 94.000 subsidie beschikbaar gesteld voor de uitvoeringsregeling ‘Presentatie beeldende kunst’ 2022. Met deze subsidieregeling moet het veelbesproken beeldende kunst podium in Hengelo een plek krijgen. Organisaties die activiteiten willen opzetten om professioneel beeldende kunstenaars in Hengelo te laten exposeren, kunnen vanaf 14 maart een aanvraag doen. Het gaat daarbij voor 2022 nog om activiteiten op bestaande en nieuwe podia. Uiteindelijk moet dit leiden tot een vaste locatie voor beeldende kunst in Hengelo. Gemeente wil grip op flitsbezorging De gemeente wil de vestiging van flitsbezorgsupermarkten kunnen reguleren. Op dit moment is dat niet mogelijk. Een flitsbezorg-organisatie kan zich nu in elk winkelpand vestigen waar de bestemming detailhandel op rust. Vanuit zo’n vestiging worden boodschappen door de stad bezorgd. Dat kan tot overlast in de omgeving leiden, leert de ervaring. Daarom heeft de gemeenteraad op 9 maart 2022 besloten tijdelijke regelgeving (= voorbereidingsbesluit) vast te stellen om grip te krijgen op nieuwe vestigingen én locaties. Belangrijke voorwaarde hierbij: geen overlast voor de omgeving. Het besluit is direct van kracht door vaststelling in de gemeenteraad. Startende ondernemers en ROZ nog minimaal 10 jaar zeker van huisvesting Op 8 maart om 15.30 uur ondertekenden Eric Markvoort, directeur bestuurder Welbions en Rob Hilarius, manager ROZ (Regionale Organisatie Zelfstandigen) een nieuw huurcontract voor Ondernemerscentrum H164 voor de komende 10 jaar, onder toeziend oog van Mariska ten Heuw, wethouder gemeente Hengelo. Het concept van aantrekkelijke kantoorgelegenheid met collega-starters, onder begeleiding van deskundige ROZ-ondernemersadviseurs heeft zijn grote waarde sinds de start van H164 in 2010 ruimschoots bewezen. Daarom zijn alle partijen het erover eens dat het contract voor de huisvesting van (startende) ondernemers én ROZ in deze inspirerende ondernemersomgeving moest worden verlengd. Kom in actie tijdens de Landelijke Opschoondag Ieder jaar organiseert Nederland Schoon de Landelijke Opschoondag. Een mooie gelegenheid om samen de strijd aan te gaan tegen zwerfafval. Op zaterdag 19 maart 2022 is het weer zover. Op deze dag worden overal in Hengelo de handen uit de mouwen gestoken. Gezamenlijk op zoek naar verloren mondkapjes, lege blikjes óf rondslingerend plastic. Terugblik raadsperiode 2018 - 2022 Voor het college en raad zit er bijna een periode van vier jaar op. Precariobelasting over 2021 geschrapt Het is inmiddels bijna 2 jaar geleden dat het coronavirus in Nederland uitbrak. Winkeliers en horecaondernemers ondervinden nog steeds de negatieve effecten van de crisis. Het college van Hengelo heeft de gemeenteraad voorgesteld de ondernemers een handreiking te bieden en voor de horeca over heel 2021 af te zien van de precarioheffing voor terrassen in de openbare ruimte. Voor de detailhandel geldt dat er over 2021 geen precario voor uitstallingen geïnd gaat worden. De gemeenteraad is op woensdagavond 9 maart akkoord gegaan met dit voorstel. Start sloop Lambertuspassage Op maandag 7 maart is de langverwachte sloop van de Lambertuspassage gestart. De passage wordt gesloopt om zo de beeldbepalende Sint Lambertusbasiliek de uitstraling te geven die zij verdient. In plaats van de passage komt een prachtige kerktuin. Hiermee krijgt dit deel van de binnenstad een groene en sfeervolle entree. De gebiedsontwikkeling is een samenwerking tussen Herstructureringsmaatschappij Overijssel (HMO) en de gemeente Hengelo. Beckum wil 130 nieuwe woningen in 2035 Burgemeester en wethouders stemmen in met de ambitie van Beckum om in de komende 10 jaar 130 woningen te realiseren én alle Beckumse voorzieningen onder te brengen in één multifunctionele accommodatie (MFA). Deze ambitie staat in het eerste deel van het omgevingsprogramma Beckum dat het dorp samen met de gemeente Hengelo heeft gemaakt. De ambitie is nodig om het dorp leefbaar te houden voor langere termijn. De Beckumse samenleving heeft vanaf het najaar 2021 actief gewerkt aan het omgevingsprogramma. Hengelo toont zich solidair met Oekraïne Zo hijst Hengelo de Oekraïense vlag, wordt de stad blauw-geel verlicht, organiseren meerdere partijen een stiltekring en speelt de beiaardier Oekraïense folklore. Onderzoek rekenkamercommissie: ‘Hengelo besteedt onderwijsgeld zorgvuldig’ De rekenkamer deed de afgelopen maanden onderzoek naar de manier waarop de gemeente begrotingsgeld besteedt aan onderwijs en leerlingzaken. De rekenkamercommissie concludeert dat de gemeente het geld voor onderwijs zorgvuldig besteedt. Twente Milieu haalt in Hengelo gratis snoeihout op Ook dit voorjaar houdt de gemeente Hengelo de jaarlijkse takkenronde. Dat gebeurt van maandag 14 maart tot en met vrijdag 25 maart. Twente Milieu haalt op afspraak gratis snoeihout op. Daarnaast kunnen Hengeloërs op zaterdag 26 maart gratis een zak compost ontvangen bij het kantoor van Twente Milieu (naast het Milieupark) aan de Wegtersweg. Daarna kunnen Hengeloërs een week lang losse compost afhalen bij het Milieupark. Nieuwe afslag op centrumring Van 28 februari tot en met 18 maart werken we aan een betere bereikbaarheid van het oude Vereenigingsgebouw van Stork. In de centrumring (Parallelweg LS), vlak voor het kruispunt met de Laan Hart van Zuid, wordt een afslag aangelegd naar het nieuwe parkeerterrein van het gebouw. De komende drie weken zijn er daarom een aantal adviesroutes en omleidingen ingesteld. De gemeente en warmtenet; onjuistheden in artikel in TcTubantia In de Tubantia van 16 februari staat een artikel “Gemeente en Ennatuurlijk steken samen 24 miljoen in Warmtebedrijf”. De informatie bevat 2 onjuistheden:     1. De bedragen zijn een factor 20 te hoog     2. De gemeente heeft helemaal nog niet besloten om een financieringsbijdrage te leveren. Vanaf 1 juni geldt Ja-Ja sticker in Hengelo Vanaf 1 juni 2022 geldt in Hengelo de Ja-Ja sticker. Met dit systeem ontvangen inwoners alléén ongeadresseerde reclamefolders als zij een Ja-Ja sticker op hun brievenbus plakken. De nieuwe regels zijn op 9 februari door de Hengelose gemeenteraad vastgesteld en opgenomen in de Afvalstoffenverordening. Het doel van de Ja-Ja sticker is om papierafval te voorkomen. Gemeenteraad stelt Omgevings-programma Nieuwe Energie vast De gemeenteraad is deze week akkoord gegaan met het Omgevingsprogramma Nieuwe Energie 2021-2030. Daarin staat de Hengelose aanpak om duurzame energie op te wekken door zon en wind te gebruiken. In het programma staan onder meer de zoekgebieden en -locaties voor zonnevelden en windturbines en hoe en met wie de gemeente die wil realiseren. Er moet nog wel eerst een uitgebreid onderzoek naar de effecten van zonne- en windenergie op de omgeving komen. Er wordt - onder andere met de andere Twentse gemeenten - een OER gemaakt (OmgevingsEffect Rapportage). Het eerste project dat op de planning staat is een zonneveld in het gebied tussen Nobian en Twence. Begin herinrichting marktplein Maandag 14 februari begint Dusseldorp met de herinrichting op en rondom het marktplein. De eerste twee delen van de Nieuwstraat zijn bijna afgerond. De rode stenen en de nieuwe plantenbakken zijn al te zien. Op dit moment is Dusseldorp nog druk bezig in het middenstuk van de Nieuwstraat. De werkzaamheden aan de noordzijde van de Brinkstraat, vanaf de Markt tot de kruising met de Enschedesestraat, zijn inmiddels ook begonnen. GBTwente verstuurt de aanslagen gemeentelijke belastingen Ergens tussen 11 februari en 20 februari ontvangen alle huishoudens in de gemeente Hengelo de aanslagen gemeentelijke belastingen van GBTwente. U ontvangt de aanslag gemeentelijke belastingen in uw Berichtenbox van MijnOverheid of per post in uw brievenbus van GBTwente. Parkeeronderzoek Hart van Zuid en omgeving Tussen 12 en 20 februari vindt er in Hart van Zuid en omgeving een parkeeronderzoek plaats, uitgevoerd door onderzoeksbureau Trajan. Trajan voert het onderzoek uit met scanauto’s, ook lopen er onderzoekers rond in de wijk. Bijdrage voor 9 kunstprojecten in Hengelo Het college heeft het advies van de commissie Beeldende Kunst en Vormgeving overgenomen om 9 van de 12 ingediende projecten een bijdrage te geven. Gemeenten bundelen krachten ten aanzien van goederenspoor door Twente Alle aspecten eerst in kaart brengen Nieuwe taxistandplaats nachthoreca bij parkeerplaats Kloosterhof De taxistandplaats voor het uitgaanspubliek was altijd op het marktplein. Het marktplein krijgt een nieuwe inrichting. De taxistandplaats voor nachthoreca is daarom niet meer te gebruiken. Er is een nieuwe taxistandplaats voor de nachthoreca gezocht én gevonden bij het parkeerterrein Kloosterhof (tussen het stadhuis en winkelcentrum Thiemsbrug). Hengelose warenmarkt vanaf 16 februari naar het Stationsplein Vanaf woensdag 16 februari 2022 is de Hengelose warenmarkt voor meer dan een jaar te vinden op het Stationsplein. Er wordt gestart met de werkzaamheden op het marktplein. De verwachte terugkeer van de warenmarkt op het vernieuwde marktplein is in het eerste kwartaal van 2023. Het marktaanbod blijft hetzelfde. Van Grijs naar Groen, hoe staan we ervoor? Gemeente Hengelo wil ‘grijze’ verharding in de openbare ruimte vervangen door extra groen. Voor alle Hengelose wijken is hiervoor 75.000 euro beschikbaar.

26,https://www.emerce.nl/nieuws/ban-via-rian-podcast-bizarre-bedrijfssoap,2022-07-29,www.emerce.nl,Newspaper/Magazine,Ban via rian podcast bizarre company soap,1,"Under the spell via Rian: podcast about a bizarre company soap You wonder whether Rian van Rijbroek will see the many reports about her controversial relationship with Twente multimillionaire and businessman Gerard Sanderink herself. Probably so, because the shutters of her villa in Veghel are firmly closed and she is constantly hiding behind pseudonyms, Tubantia reports. In any case, the Twente newspaper fully exploits her affair. A book by research editor Angelique Kunst has already been published and a podcast is now running. Which isn't very flattering either. The main question is how it is that a 52-year-old woman with a very fat Brabant accent from Veghel has one of the richest IT entrepreneurs in the Netherlands completely in her power. And crazy. His IT company Centric, which supplies ICT systems for governments, would falter due to dismissed top executives and ongoing lawsuits that were partly caused by Van Rijbroek. Employees hold the IT millionaire responsible for the recent management crisis around Centric and fear that it will result in an implosion. The Public Prosecution Service (OM) has launched a preliminary civil investigation. Last year, the childless Sanderink contradicted reports that Centric and his construction company Strukton are partly owned by Van Rijbroek. She would also have become a certificate holder in the foundation that manages the shares. After a whole series of DDoS attacks on banks and government institutions, Van Rijbroek was actually invited by Nieuwsuur as a cybersecurity expert by coincidence (another expert fell ill) in 2018. She had just written a book with PvdA politician Willem Vermeend. Who, like Sanderink, had come under the pressure of her a little too quickly. The book De wereld van Cybersecurity en Cybercrime was withdrawn after proven plagiarism. And Nieuwsuur later had to apologize: the DDoS attacks came from Dutch teenagers, not from North Korea or Iran, as Van Rijbroek had firmly claimed. A year later there was another book of hers, Unhacked. Even with the necessary errors. The media did little to debunk her claims anyway. She said she was a secret agent, worked for foreign powers and large companies. She had obtained the source codes from Kaspersky, a company for which she would also have worked. Kaspersky had never heard of the ""cyber charlatan."" Nor were cyber specialists who had never encountered this woman. What the podcast makes clear is that Van Rijbroek has preferred to seduce older entrepreneurs all her life. She knows how to impress these men with knowledge that they themselves do not have enough. Before 2017, this was mainly asset and pension management. At the time of her meeting with Vermeend, it was no coincidence that a new Mamomo BV (Mamomo stands for Make more money) had been set up, specializing in 'the development, production and publishing of software'. The podcast suggests that her brother Marc van Rijbroek may have been the inspiration. He sold a SAP-certified tax tool Taxmarc for a lot of money to consultancy firm PwC. According to experts, the fact that Sanderink (73) would be her biggest catch can be explained very well: although he was once a computer specialist in aircraft and aerospace construction, the entrepreneur nowadays still does not know how to send an e-mail or operate a smartphone. He does not read online news. Others do that for him. In particular Van Rijbroek himself, who would have sent quite a few emails on his behalf and feeds him with conspiracies. Sanderink had had a relationship with Brigitte van Egten from Enschede for many years. But it ended with a crazy phone call. Out of the blue, Sanderink suddenly accused her of theft and of 'sex with Africans'. According to him, all this had come to light thanks to ""investigations by secret services"". The stories had been whispered to him by Van Rijbroek. Your email address will not be displayed on the site. All rights reserved © Emerce",0.8312,27,14

The SolaRoad pilot cycle path alongside the N203 near Krommenie, in the Netherlands, was opened in October 2014. It is 90 m long and 3.5 m wide. The path was built by a consortium consisting of the Province of Noord-Holland, Strukton Civiel and applied scientific research organisation TNO. SolaRoad is exactly what the name suggests – a bike path with integrated solar panels, which harvests sunlight and converts it to electricity. The green electricity generated by a SolaRoad can be used for various purposes, such as public lighting, traffic management systems, households and electric mobility. In the Netherlands there is 600 km2 of road surfacing, which is more than the available roof surface. Solar roads can, therefore, provide extra capacity for generating green electricity without claiming extra space in densely populated areas and without being an eyesore. During the course of the SolaRoad project, three different versions of road were tested. A number of trials were carried out involving the composition of the top layer, solar panel design and solar cell technologies. It was found that the top layer is crucial to the path’s success. The top layer has an impact on the energy yield – the more transparent to sunlight, the more energy the road surface can generate. In addition, the top layer has to be sufficiently skid-resistant to guarantee safe use by road users. The SolaRoad project has shown that the light transmission of the top layer decreases somewhat over time due to climatic influences. The top layer also showed some local delamination, where smaller sections of the coating chipped off the surface. Major improvements were already made to the development of the top layer during the pilot project. According to the consortium responsible for SolaRoad, the project parametres demanded that riding on a solar road should be no different from using a normal road. It should also be possible to manage the road just like any road, with no amended cleaning regime required. ­ It was found that regular rain showers washed away the dirt and that the road surface, therefore, remained sufficiently clean. Attractive Energy Yield The consortium responsible for SolaRoad in July published some new results from the long-running bike path project. At the start of the trial, an energy yield of between 50 and 70 kWh/m2/year was expected. However, this figure turned out to be higher in the first year, at respectively 73  kWh/m2/year (first version, built in 2014) and 93 kWh/m2/year (second, improved version, built in 2016). Owing to the decrease in the light transmission of the top layer, the yields, in time, decreased to the expected range. With the application of thin film solar cells in two portions of the test path, valuable experience has been gained with this type of flexible solar cell, notes the consortium. It is expected that this thin film will eventually be more suitable for use in road surfaces than the brittle silicon cells used in the rest of the cycle path. The current efficiency of the flexible cells is, however, lower than some other applications, as evidenced by the yield measured of about 41 kWh/m2/year, but it is expected to rise considerably in the coming years, as the technology improves. Future Prospects “The results of the SolaRoad pilot in Krommenie are a confidence builder in the opportunities for solar roads as a valuable building block in a sustainable energy supply,” notes the consortium responsible for the project. New pilots are being planned for the beginning of 2019. SolaRoad will be demonstrated on roads exposed to heavy traffic at two locations, namely in North and South Holland respectively. The aim of the pilot is to study the performance of the pavement under heavy traffic loading, and to learn about the impact of solar pavement on daily road management and maintenance. In addition, it is being investigated how the energy yield can be further maximised.  “It is time for the next step. Valuable lessons were learnt from the pilot in Krommenie,” says Province of Noord-Holland mobility vice-governor Elisabeth Post. “We know the SolaRoad pavement can perform well on a bicycle path, and now we will test the pavement under heavy traffic loading. If the pilot is successful, the potential for large-scale application of solar pavements worldwide is enormous.” The test location with heavy traffic in Haarlemmermeer will be set up as a living lab, integrating the SolaRoad pavement into the public road. The facility will be built in stages, to allow the testing of different materials. The Noord-Holland provincial executive is providing €2.7-million in funding to the pilot project and its associated research and development.   Edited by: Creamer Media Reporter EMAIL THIS ARTICLE      SAVE THIS ARTICLE ARTICLE ENQUIRY To subscribe email subscriptions@creamermedia.co.za or click here To advertise email advertising@creamermedia.co.za or click here Engineering News is a product of Creamer Media.www.creamermedia.co.za Other Creamer Media Products include:Mining WeeklyResearch Channel AfricaPolity Sign up for our FREE daily email newsletter Receive daily sector news alerts We offer a variety of subscriptions to our Magazine, Website, PDF Reports and our photo library.

After the meeting between the two, more than four years of decisions followed that jeopardized the future of his companies to such an extent that the Public Prosecution Service deemed it necessary to intervene. On Thursday afternoon, the Public Prosecution Service demands further investigation into mismanagement at IT service provider Centric for the Enterprise Chamber at the Amsterdam Court of Appeal. In the meantime, Sanderink must be suspended as CEO and his shares – he also owns infrastructure builder Strukton, among others – must be placed with an external manager. The case is the next chapter in an unprecedented soap opera in the enterprising Netherlands. Rarely did a businessman listed in the Quote 500 make the news in such a way. Several executives and senior managers left his companies or were fired. He conducted dozens of lawsuits against his ex-girlfriend Brigitte van Egten, whom he accuses of, among other things, fraud and placing porn on the servers of one of his companies. Both claims have been brushed aside by the judge several times. In recent years, those involved have been clear about who is behind the accusations: his current girlfriend Van Rijbroek. She would feed Sanderink with information about conspiracies inside and outside his companies. In this way she would have set up Sanderink against administrators and other close contacts. Read more about the resignation of Centric directors in June 2022 here: Drivers leave again after a conflict with Gerard Sanderink In 2018, for example, the Centric board was in negotiations with a major customer, regulator De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), when Sanderink suddenly threatened to intervene. He had understood through Van Rijbroek that DNB could not be trusted as a contract partner. The board managed to prevent the negotiations from ending in a fiasco after a tender that had been won, but the conflict did lay the foundation for an exodus of personnel from Centric and later Strukton and the engineering firm Antea Group. For the first time it became clear what influence Van Rijbroek had on Sanderink and what this could mean for his companies. Van Rijbroek is not officially employed by Centric, but he did think about, for example, a cybersecurity division that the company would start a few years ago (it is unclear whether this ever got off the ground). It is also suspected that various emails with accusations about Sanderink’s ex-wife Van Egten are from the Veghelse. At the beginning of 2021, things seemed to calm down around Sanderink’s companies. After Sanderink fell out against a bailiff, he left Strukton and Centric as a director. Sanderink had again had a dubious report with fraud allegations about his ex-girlfriend. The source of the allegations would again have been Van Rijbroek. The judge ordered the entrepreneur to rectify those allegations, but Van Egten wanted to know with whom they had been shared and had Sanderink’s mailbox and telephone seized from Strukton. When a bailiff came at the end of 2020 to copy the data, Sanderink threatened him and had his phone erased remotely. The fuss that arose about this led to such pressure from customers, among others, on the entrepreneur that he resigned from his board positions. However, he remained involved as a shareholder. It didn’t take long: later that year he made a comeback in Strukton’s group management. In June of this year, things got restless around Centric again. Three drivers left. In their view, Sanderink had abused his power by claiming compensation of 1.9 million euros through Centric previously awarded by the court to Van Egten. Sanderink thought that the company would have been damaged by statements that Van Egten made about Centric in various legal proceedings. The court rejected that claim at the time and accused Centric and Sanderink of abuse of rights. Also read: The Public Prosecution Service is reaching for a heavy means to depose Gerard Sanderink At the beginning of July of this year, the Public Prosecution Service announced that it would start a preliminary civil investigation into Centric. This happened after MP Pieter Omtzigt, among others, expressed his concerns about the consequences of the unrest at the company for government services (for example, in recent years it provided part of the IT infrastructure at the regulator DNB and many municipalities also use of Centric’s software). Central question in the Public Prosecution Service investigation: how can the continuity of the company be guaranteed? That research showed that there is a high turnover of staff, which makes the service provision vulnerable. Recently, several important customers have also canceled their contract with the automation company. While the investigation was in its final phase, Sanderink announced two weeks ago that he would return to Centric as a top executive. That was enough for the Public Prosecution Service. It asks the Enterprise Chamber to start an investigation into possible mismanagement at the company and to suspend Sanderink in the meantime and to transfer the shares to external management. For example, Sanderink cannot make important decisions at his companies during his possible suspension. The entrepreneur can defend himself against this on Thursday. Gerard Sanderink (74) from Twente founded the Sanderink Groep in 1992, later renamed Centric (turnover 2021: 422 million euros, approximately 3,800 employees). With the company, Sanderink provides IT services for, among others, (local) governments. Companies such as ASML and Spar also belonged to the clientele. Centric grew into one of the most important IT companies in the Netherlands through acquisitions of smaller competitors. In 2005 Sanderink took over the listed engineering firm Oranjewoud. Five years later, infrastructure builder and NS subsidiary Strukton (2020 turnover: 1.9 billion euros, 6,500 employees) was added. That company also came to hang under the Oranjewoud coat rack. Strukton was visited by the tax investigation service FIOD at the beginning of 2019. The Public Prosecution Service suspects that Strukton may be involved in paying bribes for a metro project in Saudi Arabia. At the beginning of 2022, Sanderink bought out the last strand of shareholders and took Oranjewoud off the stock exchange. In addition, Sanderink also owns solar panel company DSS. His net worth is now estimated by Quote at 505 million euros. Sanderink has been together with Rian van Rijbroek since the autumn of 2018. He previously had a long-standing relationship with Brigitte van Egten. Brigitte van Egten is Gerard Sanderink’s ex-girlfriend. During their relationship, Van Egten was director of Sanderink’s solar panel company DSS, from 2003 to 2018. The relationship lasted until November 2018, when Sanderink was now together with Rian van Rijbroek. Shortly afterwards, Sanderink accused Van Egten of, among other things, fraud at DSS. She also allegedly had several terabytes of porn put on DSS servers. No evidence has ever been found for this. Sanderink also said that Van Egten was behind the FIOD raid on Strukton. The two have been involved in lawsuits for years about Sanderink’s accusations and his statements. Sanderink has been sentenced to rectification several times. He has also been ordered to pay fines worth millions. Rian van Rijbroek (1969) is a cyber entrepreneur from Brabant (with his own company: MaMoMo, Make More Money) who gained national fame in 2018 with a highly criticized performance at Nieuwsuur. In it she stated, among other things, that the North Korean secret service was behind a series of (at the time recent) DDos attacks on Dutch banks. It later turned out that an eighteen-year-old Dutch boy was behind the attacks. Tech experts dismissed the claims as scaremongering and said they did not know Van Rijbroek. Research by various media also showed that at least part of Van Rijbroek’s CV turned out to be incorrect. Shortly afterwards, the Veghelse made the news again. A book she wrote with former politician and professor Willem Vermeend was withdrawn from the market when it turned out that various passages had been copied without citing the source. Since Van Rijbroek has been together with Sanderink, she has also become involved in several lawsuits. For example, Sanderink’s ex-girlfriend Brigitte van Egten tries to show that Van Rijbroek is the source of various accusations about her. Last year, Van Egten had several terabytes of data from Rian van Rijbroek seized. A judge is currently examining the extent to which Van Egten may gain access to this.

Here’s why trial run has been held up Though the order for the inductor was made in June, much time has been wasted in bringing it to Kurla car-shed, where currently the train is undergoing maintenance, officials said. The AC rake manufactured by the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) and Strukton, a Netherlands-based firm, had arrived in Mumbai on April 1. CR authorities had already missed its earlier deadlines (May 16, June 30 and August 31) of conducting static trials. “Improper co-ordination between the manufacturers and CR authorities delayed the inductor for conducting trials. The instrument supposed to come in June will now be hopefully received by September, post which commissioning can be expected to begin trials,” a CR official said. Static trials of the rake will test the interface between the software and the equipment installed. Officials confirmed that out of a fourteen-day schedule of this phase of trials, thirteen have already been completed and the wait continues for the inductor. “Our team has successfully completed majority of trials of the AC rake. We are waiting for the inductor to be received, post which trials will be re-run to check smooth co-ordination between the motor coach and other coaches. The rake cannot be considered fit to run without doing so,” he added. Commissioning permission can be availed of by mid-September if the inductor is in place with CR authorities by September 1. The trials can begin from September 30 post which dynamic trials of the rake can be started. However, officials seem puzzled on deciding the line for conducting the trials. “As height of the AC rake could clash with some railway-over- bridges (ROBs) between route of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST)-Kurla, conducting dynamic trials there will be difficult. Also, problems exist with conducting trials on trans-harbor line as well. It may thus run on the route between Kurla-Karjat or Kasara and then on Western Railway (WR) line for trials,” a senior CR official said. Also, officials confirmed it is too early to think about deciding fares or marking routes. “The rake is yet to qualify many trials. It may run on WR if Commission of Railway Safety certifies so. There is also a possibility that other AC rakes manufactured would be lower in height and would run on CR,” the official added. It is only after the prototype rake is set in place that the other AC rakes are constructed on a similar model. “After specifications are given to the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) about smooth running of this rake, the next one will come within a month. It is necessary that the first AC rake runs with the second in place as any operational issue with the first will require an immediate replacement with the second,” the official added. The Railways had placed an order for ten air-conditioned rakes from BHEL. Built at a cost of Rs 54 crore, the entire rake would be vestibule-connected and has a seating capacity of 1,208 and standing capacity of 4,936 passengers.   Mississippi man sentenced to 8 years for trying to join Islamic State Neha Kulkarni",0.5122,32,47
32,https://www.lifegate.com/larantuka-straits-tidal-power-indonesia,2018-06-11,www.lifegate.com,Newspaper/Magazine,Larantuka straits tidal power Indonesia,1,"Larantuka Straits, Indonesia will be home to the largest tidal power plant in the world It will serve 100,000 people and help overcome some of the challenges of energy provision in Indonesia. The largest tidal power plant in the world will be built in the Larantuka Straits in the island of Flores, eastern Indonesia: it will provide energy for at least 100,000 people. Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 17,500 islands, with nearly 260 million people occupying less than half of these, which means that building efficient energy provision infrastructure is a challenge, particularly in the eastern part, where the islands are small (except for Papua) and spread over a wide area. Whilst the country relies mostly on coal, as it has significant reserves of this dirty fuel that can be extracted and processed at a low cost, about 20 million people remained without electricity in 2017. In addition, it has significant unutilised renewable energy potential, including a total of 60 gigawatts from tidal waves. As has been widely demonstrated, the use of fossil fuels is ridden with serious problems, including increasing costs, depleting resources and the negative impact of coal-based plants on surrounding communities and the environment. Also, it puts Indonesia among the biggest contributors to climate change. Its government has made a commitment to increasing the share of renewable energy in national energy provision, from the current level of a little under 8 per cent to almost a quarter by 2025 (through government regulation 79/2014). This will be aligned with international climate change mitigation efforts, with the country stating it will voluntarily reduce emissions by around a third by 2030. About 314 million tonnes of CO2 are expected to be cut from the energy sector. Renewable energy is actually an effective solution for an extensive archipelago such as Indonesia, as small islands and remote areas are mostly not connected to the electricity grid. Stretching the grid to these from the nearest major islands is also too costly and has been proven to be ineffective. Instead, renewable energy can be harvested directly on small and remote islands. The Larantuka Straits project will begin with the construction of the Pancasila-Palmerah Bridge that will function as a barrage (dam) where state-of-the-art turbines turbines will be installed to transform the kinetic energy of tides’ rise and fall of the tides into electricity. As simple as that. The construction, which should be complete by 2020, is integrated with other development projects that will represent an economic boost for more than 250,000 people, as well as a concrete contribution to mitigating climate change. Following completion of a feasibility study that included an environmental impact assessment, the government formed a consortium to run the project. According to Strukton International, one of the companies responsible for cosntructing the tidal bridge, it is estimated that the first phase of the project will absorb 200 million dollars in investments and will have an installed capacity of 18 to 23 megawatts, though tidal power in the area has a potential of 300 megawatts. The following stage will see the extension of the power plant to a capacity of 90 to 115 megawatts, backed by another 350 million dollars in investments. By then it is expected that the structure could provide energy for about half a million people. The project is doubly aimed at establishing reliable energy provision and boosting local infrastructure, states Luhut Pandjaitan, Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs. The 800-metre bridge will connect Adonara Island to the eastern tip of Flores, enabling economic activity to be opened up. It will also be integrated with a container hub as part of President Joko Widodo’s Sea Toll Programme to turn the country into a global maritime hub, as well as the extension of Gewayantana Airport’s runway. Indonesia is one of the most thriving economies in the world, where growth is stable at about 5-6 per cent per year. Its huge population creates a large domestic market, where nearly 60 per cent of growth is fuelled by private consumption backed by a growing and affluent middle class. The government is aware that this positive trend can only last if the underpinning factor, which is infrastructure, is well-developed. Economic growth can only stand on adequate roads, ports, airport, railways, water provision structures and power plants, over all regions. And all these require energy. Joko Widodo’s administration has been working on a very ambitious infrastructure development programme. To support this, a fast-track policy has been launched to add 35,000 megawatts of new power by the end of its term in 2019, and the the Larantuka Straits tidal power plant will contribute to this objective. Tidal energy is released by tidal movements as a result of the gravitational and centrifugal forces of the Earth, moon and sun, resulting in two high tides and two low ones for every landmass. These occur at regular times during the day, meaning that this form of energy is stable, periodic and predictable. This also differentiates them from oceanic currents, which are slow-moving and unpredictable. Tidal energy involves the installation of clean infrastructure undersea and its efficiency is high. For example, compared to wind power, which applies similar technology, the output of tidal power is 80 per cent higher because water is much denser than wind. The highest tidal ranges, the difference between its low and high points, in the world include the Baie du Mont-Saint-Michel in France (13.5 metres), Severn Estuary in the UK (15 metres) and the Bay of Fundy in Canada (16 metres). The tidal range in Larantuka Straits has been evaluated to be adequate, meeting the required speed for energy production, therefore moving Indonesia in the right direction to fuel the growth of its booming economy whilst respecting the limits of the environment.

They need more modern options like Big Data, a process aimed at analyzing and systematically extracting information from data sets that are too large or complex to handle via traditional processing methods. Through the process, railroads can convert data into usable information that can help them better plan annual maintenance and capital programs. Since Big Data is growing in value as railroads continue to gather and process more information generated from technological advances, the University of Delaware offers a conference each year that focuses on the trending topic — specifically, data analytics and associated statistical analysis techniques. The sixth iteration of the Big Data in Railroad Maintenance Planning Conference was held Dec. 11-12, 2019, at the Trabant University center in Newark, Delaware. The event is organized by the University of Delaware’s railroad engineering and safety program, Big Data center and professional engineering outreach arm. The 2019 edition aimed to expand on previous years’ conferences by introducing new and emerging analysis techniques, and showing how they can be applied to the large volume of inspection data collected by railroads, says Allan Zarembski, a University of Delaware professor who directs the conference. The more than 30 presentations were targeted at helping railroads improve their capital and maintenance program planning efforts, including for both track infrastructure and rolling stock. “We usually have had mostly a track audience, but we’re finding that more and more people want presentations on the mechanical side or operating side,” says Zarembski, who also is the director of the university’s railroad engineering and safety program. “They want to learn about different approaches.” Speakers hailed from a wide range of rail industry stakeholders, including Amtrak, BNSF Railway Co., CN, CSX, Brazil’s MRS Logistica, the Federal Railroad Administration, Penn State Altoona, State University of New York at Buffalo, Alstom, Railinc, Georgetown Rail Equipment Co., Plasser & Theurer, Strukton Rail, ENSCO Inc. and Uptake Technologies Inc. Presentations addressed managing data and data analytics, combining data streams with different technologies, using machine learning to focus on maintenance needs and employing text mining in data analysis. Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task using patterns and inference. Rutgers University Professor Trefor Williams and Collaborative Solutions LLC Managing Member John Betak discussed the use of topic modeling — or text mining — to identify overriding themes in U.S. and Great Britain rail accidents, says Zarembski. “They talked about using word recognition technology to analyze rail accidents, to look for words that are often repeated in accident reports,” he says. “There’s more to data analysis than just crunching numbers.” The sessions helmed by several universities offered more aggressive takes on data analytics, such as pattern recognition techniques, Zarembski says. For example, Milan Afzalan, Farrokh Jazizadeh Karimi and Mehdi Ahmadian from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University — or more commonly Virginia Tech — talked about assessing track conditions by using scalable onboard data and machine learning. A major conference highlight was the Dec. 11 keynote address from Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) General Manager Jeff Knueppel, says Zarembski. Knueppel — who retired at 2019’s end — described the authority’s journey with Big Data, an effort aimed at forging a more effective organization. SEPTA is counting on Big Data to help improve safety and the customer experience, optimize spending and workforce planning, spur more informed decisions, and eventually increase the predictability of operations, maintenance and capital programming. The authority long has tried to replace old manual and formulaic processes with automated ones, says SEPTA Director of Innovation Erik Johanson, who helped with Knueppel’s presentation and reviewed it last month. For example, real-time remote condition monitoring of assets can provide automatic alerts of any unusual conditions. SEPTA has employed a TekTracking LLC remote monitoring system proof of concept at its 40th Street trolley portal. Such automation is targeted to help authority officials better understand the root causes of problems, recalibrate maintenance intervals and — over time — increase the potential to predict component failures. SEPTA has nearly reached the automated stage and now is in the preliminary stages of moving toward the predictive stage, which is the “holy grail,” says Johanson. To be predictive, the authority will need to evaluate and invest in new data sources, promote data-driven decision making and turn data into actionable insights. “Data now is in silos, so we need to break them down,” Johanson says. “The goal is to have an organizational pool of data that everyone has access to.” Service quality would improve substantially because arrival times would be more predictable, he says. Plus, maintenance personnel would know when switches or other components would fail. “You can better understand various aspects of your business,” Johanson says. For now, as part of the ongoing automation push, SEPTA continues to implement a new fare card system featuring an open payment system that requires no tokens or paper fares. The authority wants to continue leveraging data to modernize and boost efficiency, including the constant search for better ways to gather, store and disseminate all data sources, says Johanson. For example, SEPTA continues to adopt a second generation of an automated passenger counter (APC) technology that’s more sophisticated than the prior generation. The APC provides time-stamped and geocoded data with limitless analytical potential, and affords opportunities for customer rewards or more dynamic pricing, says Johanson. SEPTA also employs cellular modems on all buses and most of its rail fleet. A radio-based dispatch system previously polled the location of a rail car or bus every three minutes, but the modems poll every 30 seconds, providing better vehicle locations for customers, says Johanson. Coupled with a new mobile application, the modems also help improve fleet management and scheduling. “It’s all about going from old to better ways for a predictive platform,” Johanson says. The future in leveraging data will focus on safety and inspections, such as the use of GPS-enabled drones to inspect infrastructure above ground and GPS-denied drones to inspect tunnels or subways underground using special sensors, he says. In addition, SEPTA is considering or adopting the use of ground-penetrating radar and ultrasonic testing devices for inspections. Rail asset inspections and maintenance in a Big Data context also were the crux of a Dec. 11 presentation conducted jointly by CSX and VisioStack Inc. The session was a prime example of leveraging advanced data analytics, says the University of Delaware’s Zarembski. CSX Manager of Inspection and Records Stephen Love and VisioStack Data Scientist Joshua Doran discussed the Class I’s use of VisioStack’s RaiLinks™ tool for rail inspections and maintenance. CSX and VisioStack began working together in early 2018 to better align and synch the massive amounts of inspection and maintenance data the railroad was generating from many sources, says Love, who reviewed the presentation last month. The VisioStack data alignment tool enables CSX to visualize and disseminate data on cell phones, tablets and laptops, he says. Data — including high-resolution images and potential rail defects — is gathered from unmanned and manual test cars, other detection cars, LIDAR devices and visual inspections conducted by field inspectors. The tool is designed to support data organization, searches and sharing on a high scale. “We can see changes in data over time, see what’s trending or if there’s been a critical exception,” Love says. “It helps with making decisions — we can better plan work windows and how capital dollars are spent.” CSX began to provide RaiLinks to field managers in second-quarter 2019, and more than 100 of them now use it. The Class I plans to continue developing the tool with VisioStack while gathering feedback from users, says Love. “It’s customizable, so it can be suited to our needs,” he says. CSX aims to roll out RaiLinks to field personnel in the second quarter. The tool currently is used for track maintenance, but there will be other applications in the future, says Love. In 2018, the railroad covered more than 57,000 miles of track with test cars, but in 2019 — after using an unmanned test car and the VisioStack tool for the first time — about 200,000 miles of track were covered. “Without the tool, that would have been very difficult to do,” Love says. CSX expects to cover even more track miles in 2020 because the railroad will be using a total of three unmanned test cars, he says. Such positive results from Big Data are driven by research and development, and the academic world plays a large role in R&D. To that end, the University of Delaware aims to incorporate graduate students’ projects into the conference through poster sessions. Held in conjunction with an evening reception on Dec. 11, the sessions enabled seven graduate students to display and explain their research. “Many found the opportunity to talk to the students very enlightening,” Zarembski says, adding that the university might expand the poster sessions at the 2020 conference. One thing that likely won’t change at the next event: the attendance fee. The conference is free because the university relies on sponsors to cover costs, says Zarembski. The 2019 edition drew six platinum and seven gold sponsors. “We have heard from people that it’s easier for them to attend if they don’t have to worry about a fee,” says Zarembski.

34,https://www.railjournal.com/regions/europe/get-set-for-innotrans-2016/,2016-09-08,www.railjournal.com,Newspaper/Magazine,Get set for innotrans,1,"Get set for InnoTrans 2016 Kevin Smith and Dan Templeton are here to guide you though some of the highlights. Suppliers from around the globe will be out in force to provide a vast shop window of the latest innovations that are set to drive the railway industry forward over the next few years. Indeed, Messe Berlin reports, as it does every two years, that records are set to fall in 2016 with well over 100,000 visitors expected, and 2940 exhibitors - 200 of them making their debut - from 60 countries. Of these exhibitors, 60% are from outside Germany, reflecting the international importance of the event, with leading railway executives and politicians expected to visit the show throughout the four days. Navigating such a large event is inevitably a major challenge. But fear not, IRJ has done some of the hard work for you in our traditional event preview, and features some of the most note-worthy innovations that will be on display in Berlin. We hope you enjoy the show! Plasser and Theurer (Hall 26, stand 222) will introduce a newly-developed universal two-sleeper tamping unit for tracks and turnouts. The 8x4 unit combines the flexibility of universal one-sleeper tamping units in split-head design with the increased output of two-sleeper tamping operations. The new unit can control the speed of the vibration drive, saving time by increasing the output in encrusted ballast while reducing maintenance costs. Outside Plasser will show two machines: a TIF tunnel inspection vehicle (Outside track T8/45) and Unimat 09-32/4S Dynamic E(3^) which uses a hybrid drive. Railshine, France (Hall 23a, stand 708) will display its Global Railway Service-Station concept for rolling stock depots and workshops. The solution is based on its Train Feeding Solutions range and the available features include retractable rigid catenary, locomotive sand filling systems, exhaust fume extraction systems, and an anti-icing system. It also includes a remotely-managed and supervised fuel service station. The highlight exhibit for Frauscher (Hall 25, stand 232) is Frauscher Tracking Solutions (FTS), a wheel detection and train tracking technology system. The company will also present the new Frauscher Alarming and Maintenance System (FAMS) which allows operators to monitor all of their Frauscher axle counter components at a glance. Stadler (Hall 2.2, stand 103) will unveil its EC250, which will be one of the star exhibits of this year’s outside track area. The EC250 or Giruno train high-speed train for Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) is set to begin operating passenger services through the Gotthard Base Tunnel from 2019. Stadler received a SFr 970m ($US 985.3m) order for 29 11-car EC250 sets in October 2014 and the first few completed coaches will be on display at T8/40. Stadler says the train will represent a new level of comfort for transalpine passengers, with high specifications in terms of acoustics and pressure protection. The train also features low-floor boarding, making it straightforward for passengers to board and alight, including those with reduced mobility, and includes a digital passenger information system which indicates where there are available seats on the train. This low-floor design has also influenced the construction of the car body, which demanded creativity from engineers, particularly in the entrance areas, and for installing sub-systems due to the reduced space available below the floor of the train. In addition, engineers had to consider the unique challenges of travelling through the 57km Gotthard Base Tunnel, particularly the air pressure, high levels of humidity and 35oC temperatures. A pressure-protected interior, air-conditioning control and air-flow around the pantograph are some of the adjustments made to ensure the train can operate effectively through the tunnel, while the train is designed to continue operating under its own power in order to be able to reach an emergency stop in the event of a fire. While the first few coaches will be on show in Berlin, the first 11-car train will not begin testing until spring 2017, while it is set to undergo testing at the Rail Tec Arsenal facility in Vienna in the second half of next year. In addition to Giruno, Stadler will show several new trains at the outside track area, including the Flirt EMU for Netherlands Railways (NS) (T9/40), Variobahn tram-train for Aarhus, Denmark (T4/15), and sleeping cars for Azerbaijan Railways (ADDV) (T9/42). The Swiss manufacturer will also display products from its new plant in Valencia, which it acquired from Vossloh in December 2015, including the Eurodual locomotive for British rail freight operator, Direct Rail Services, (T8/43), and Citylink tram-train for Chemnitz (T4/29). CAF (Hall 3.2, stand 401) will highlight its Civity range of trains at InnoTrans. CAF has continued to expand its European export activities in 2016, particularly in the British market, where it has signed contracts for the supply of Civity UK trains to Arriva UK, First Group, and Eversholt Rail.

35,https://www.cleantech.com/turning-tide-for-ocean-power-is-marine-energy-coming-of-age/,2017-05-24,www.cleantech.com,Newspaper/Magazine,Turning tide for ocean power is marine energy coming of age,1,"Cleantech Group Below is a quick overview of what we’re seeing in terms of trends, innovators, and partnerships, but for a closer look at this space, please do get in touch with us at research@cleantech.com. There are at least four different technologies to harness the energy of the sea – ocean thermal energy, salinity gradient energy, tidal energy, and wave energy. Ocean thermal conversion exploits the difference in temperature between deep and surface waters, while salinity gradient generation converts the difference in salt concentration between fresh and saltwater, typically found in fjords and deltas. Although a few start-ups such as Bluerise and REDstack are active in this space, these technologies remain largely in the concept stage and we’ll therefore focus on the latter two below. While wave energy converters capture energy from the motion of waves through either floating or submerged devices, tidal turbines generate electricity from the tides caused by the gravitational force of the moon and can be mounted to the seabed like submarine wind turbines (tidal stream), or integrated within a barrier impounding a lagoon (tidal range). Advantages of tidal energy – apart from being clean and renewable – are its potential efficiency and predictability. As water is much denser than air, turbines can be smaller and generate energy from far slower velocities than wind turbines. Even more importantly, tides are not as erratic as winds but happen twice a day, which has the potential to offset the intermittent nature of solar and wind and makes annual production calculations much easier. Benefits of wave energy converters, on the other hand, include a very low impact on aquatic life, and the high power density resulting from multiple planes of movement (waves not only roll past the device, but push it up and down and side-to-side). Both technologies could also be deployed at smaller scales for offgrid applications and energy security on small islands that typically suffer from energy scarcity and/or high electricity prices. Carnegie Clean Energy, for example, has been awarded $2.5M by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency late last year for a wave-powered microgrid project to be implemented on Garden Island in Western Australia in the coming months.      (Photo credits: clockwise from the top left, Wello, Carnegie Clean Energy, Atlantis Resources, Sabella,) Similar to offshore wind farms, the deployment of these technologies faces challenges from difficulties in grid connections, as well as the harsh (salty & stormy) and remote (underwater) environment in which they are to be implemented. This explains in part why no single dominant design has yet to emerge for wave energy converters, and also why progress has been stymied by a few bankruptcies of early movers, such as Pelamis Wave Power and Aquamarine Power, gone out of business in 2014 and 2015, respectively. However, we’ve also seen a plethora of new start-ups appear in our i3 platform in recent years. Relatedly, investment activity in the scene seems to have picked up the pace again with a number of equity and project financing rounds for innovators such as the InnoEnergy Spin-off CorPower Ocean, AW-Energy and Carnegie Clean Energy. Large utilities are taking up the race as well, with players such as ENEL Green Power partnering with the Italian start-up, 40SouthEnergy, and Finnish utility Fortum aiming to deploy the first multi-megawatt wave farm in 2020 off the coast of Scotland in a partnership with the Finnish start-up, Wello. More research, pilot projects and experimentation like these will still be necessary before wave technologies become viable and competitive enough for wider industrial rollout. The tidal energy industry has already seen initial large-scale capabilities deployed last year, and has more than one multi-megawatt project under construction. With a total lease capacity of 398MW, the MeyGen project installed in Pentland Firth (Scotland) by Atlantis Resources is the largest tidal energy farm in operation to date. But more are yet to come. Just last month, Tidal Bridge BV, a joint venture of DEC and Strukton International has been awarded the Palmerah Tidal Bridge Project in Indonesia, which will have an installed capacity of up to 115MV and has a contract value of an estimated $550 million. Other known names include Engie, Alstom, EDF, and Repsol, who have all been involved early on and have partnered with start-ups, such as Sabella or Tocardo, to speed up the development of tidal turbines. The Swedish company, Minesto, received attention two months ago when it closed a limited public share offering with $8 million in proceeds for an innovative tidal kite design, pointing out that the last word has not been said on the shape of tidal technologies to come. While Europe is clearly spearheading innovation for ocean power, other countries such as Israel and Canada are advancing fast. With the potential for off grid applications, more developments for island states and remote coastal areas can be expected. Capitalizing on existing offshore infrastructures, naval capabilities, and under-used harbors might open up additional new pathways for deployments. For years, the spotlight has focussed on green energy, with blue energy gaining momentum in fits and starts. While tidal energy now seems on the crest of maturity with various deployments being carried out worldwide, wave energy has yet to breach the surface",0.025,36,42

 Open the e-magazine Three companies on the top 30 list have more employees than the other 27 combined. Peab, Skanska and NCC continue to dominate in Byggsverige. It is Byggföretagen that produced a compilation in which the employers' organization ranked the 30 largest construction companies in the country according to the number of employees in the country. Peab is at the top closely followed by Skanska and NCC. Then there is a big gap down to Veidekke in fourth place. - When it comes to the number of employees and turnover, Peab, Skanska and NCC are in a class of their own. With a total turnover of more than SEK 100 billion and over 25,000 employees in Sweden, these three are bigger than the other 27 companies on the list combined, says Emil Flodin, analyst at Byggföretagen in a comment. This year, for the first time, the companies are ranked according to the number of employees instead of, as before, according to how much they turnover. Something else that also differs from before is the selection, as Byggföretagen clearly wants to bring out companies that are more purely construction and construction companies. In addition, only Swedish companies that prepared an annual report in Sweden were included in the list. Below in the facts box, you can read the entire list.

 The new plant, known as the Palmerah Tidal Bridge, will be built into a floating 800 metre-long bridge on the Larantuka Strait in East Flores, and promises to deliver power capacity of 18 to 23 megawatts (MW), providing enough electricity for 100,000 people in the area. It is the first deal to emerge from a strategic hydropower alliance between the Indonesian and Dutch governments. A second phase of construction could see capacity increased to 90 to 115 MW, enough power for more than half a million Indonesians in a region that largely relies on polluting diesel generators for electricity. An artist’s impression of the Palmerah Tidal Bridge. Image: Tidal Bridge BV  Environmental group Greenpeace has said that it approves of the project as an alternative to coal in fossil fuels-dependent Indonesia, but that caution is needed to ensure that the biodiversity of the marine environment is not affected. Tidal power is a relatively uncommon form of renewable energy that harnesses the energy of marine currents, a potentially more reliable power source than wind or the sun. The International Energy Agency estimates that in 2014, global tidal power capacity was about 0.5GW, compared to 128GW of solar and 8.8GW of offshore wind. Indonesia is an ideal location for tidal power, because of strong ocean currents that move between the world’s largest archipelago’s thousands of islands. The Larantuka Strait between Flores and Adonara is one such area, with a number of sites now being considered by the Indonesian government. The Palmerah Tidal Bridge is also being trumpeted as a way of improving grid connectivity in the eastern part of Indonesia, and giving people in the area better access to education, healthcare and job opportunities. The project has been awarded to Tidal Bridge BV, a joint venture between Dutch engineering firm Strukton International and venture capital fund Dutch Expansion Capital. It is slated to be completed by 2019 at a cost of US$550 million. The companies behind the project claim Palmerah Tidal Bridge will be the largest tidal power facility in the world. However, South Korea’s Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station, with power output of 254 MW, has around double the capacity of the Palmerah project, as does the Rance Tidal Power Station in France, with power capacity of 240 MW. Greenpeace Indonesia climate and energy campaigner Hindun Mulaika told Eco-Business that the organisation supported the development of renewable energy in Indonesia, a country that is a big coal extractor and user, and continues to approve plans to build new coal-fired power plants to meet its growing energy demands. Around 50 million Indonesians are without reliable electricity, and president Joko Widowo’s 35,000 MW plan to electrify the country is slated to use mostly coal (20,000 MW, or 57 per cent) to deliver power to those without it. A report by Greenpeace released in January predicted that if plans to build new coal power plants go ahead in Indonesia, it will suffer more deaths as a result of air pollution than any country in Southeast Asia. Hindun said that the group “supports the development of renewable energy to foster the transition away from huge coal dependencies in the country.” “We found a perfect example in Palmerah Tidal Power Plant where the energy source can be found in local resources, which will surely cut distribution costs that commonly occur in big centralised power plants,” she noted. “But for any renewable project that is developed in Indonesia, it needs to be based on comprehensive research, in this case fish passage design for the tidal bridge and power plant development for the mitigation measures,” she said. “The project design and its implementation should consider and ensure it does not harm the environment and biodiversity, particularly marine mammals, turtles and whale sharks and their ecosystems,” added Hindun, stressing that the environmental assessment of this project should also take into account migration routes of fish and other marine mammals.  The tidal plant should also allow fishermen to pass through the straight easily, and consideration is also needed for the potentially increased sedimentation above and below the dams, so as not to impact local fisheries, she said. Eric van den Eijnden, chief executive officer, Tidal Bridge, told Eco-Business that research had been done to assess the environmental impact of the bridge on biodiversity in the area, and that the consequences would be “very limited”. He said that water speed would decrease as a result of the bridge, but this has “no known” environmental consequences. Eco-Business has requested for Tidal Bridge BV to share the results of its research, including the likely impact on local communities. The company has yet to produce its findings.  Van den Eijnden added that fish mortality at the hands of the massive turbines that power the plant would be “negligible” because the turbines are “fish-friendly”— designed to prevent fish from being crushed when they pass through it. Van den Eijnden added: “[Local] fishermen are very enthusiastic because we respect the shipping lanes and they can use the electricity to build cool cells. With this [electricity], they are able to freeze the catch and are thus able to build up a proper industry.”  Tidal power has proved to be controversial in Korea, home of the world’s largest tidal power plants, despite the technology’s renewable status. Environmental groups and fishermen in Korea have predicted that large tidal power plants will bring about deep and lasting harm to tidal ecosystems, fisheries and the landscape. They have also complained about a lack of environmental impact studies to investigate the potential impact of tidal power plants.

With this capsule, also called pod , the team will participate in the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition in the summer of 2019. The fastest pod in the vacuum tube will be the winner of this competition taking place in Los Angeles, California. The team's goal is to win and break the current world record of 467 km/h on a one kilometer track. The TU Delft Hyperloop team consists of 40 students who build a fully working prototype for the race in one year. This race will take place on July 21 in Hawthorn on the SpaceX site. Of the 22 globally selected teams, only three teams will actually be allowed to enter the tube to race. These three teams are chosen based on 122 safety tests conducted in the week leading up to the race. “These tests are intended to demonstrate that our vehicle is working properly and that all safety requirements are met. There are elements that are tested such as: the braking system, whether the pod can handle the vacuum in the tube and whether the software works properly. These tests must all be completed successfully before the final run”, says Team Captain Rieneke van Noort. In order to prepare as well as possible for the test week, the student team is currently already busy carrying out comparable tests. For example, parts such as the motors, wheels and brakes have already been tested on a flywheel; a spinning aluminum disc that can simulate the material, movement and weight of the pod to mimic a run in the tube of SpaceX. In addition, the subsystems were also tested in vacuum by letting the pod 'run' in the vacuum tube of startup Hardt global. Since vehicle testing is a crucial factor in increasing the chances of winning, the team has been given the unique opportunity to test their entire pod on a section of track next to Hilversum Station. The team was able to realize this 300-metre long test track in collaboration with Voestalpine RailPro, ProRail and Strukton. Now that the pod has been unveiled, the team can start testing on this test track. With the vehicle, the Hyperloop team aims to go faster than 500 km/h within one kilometer. In this kilometer you will have to accelerate and slow down. For this reason, the vehicle will have to brake several times faster than a Formula 1 car. The vehicle will be powered by an electric motor. Next month the Delft Hyperloop team will leave for Los Angeles. This means moving the vehicle, all team members and the workplace to Hawthorne, California; the space of SpaceX, to dot the i's and cross the t's here before the race. Chief Engineer Elja Ebbens: “With the knowledge that the team has gathered during testing, we are now extremely well prepared for the test week. We therefore consider the chances of reaching the final and being allowed to race in the tube.” This article is a submission to the editor and is not the responsibility of the editors.

The ex-chair of Chiltern Railways now leads Vivarail, which bought much or all of the D78 stock from TfL – about 150 driving motor cars and enough vehicles altogether to form 75 units of two or three car trains. With electrification timescales looking shaky, there could be a growing need for diesel alternatives in the short to medium term, which Vivarail think they can provide. Their vision is for a new, cheap 60mph DEMU that could plug the gap – using Ford automotive engines on re-engineered District Line stock that originally came into service in 1980. Although the RMT union and others have criticised the trains as “London’s cast-offs” and branded them 'Crawlers' because of their speed, Shooter insisted in an interview with RTM that the D-Train has so many elements being replaced or upgraded that “this is effectively a new train – but we’re making it very affordable by reusing the body shell, which is aluminium and has no corrosion, and the bogies, which are only about 10 years old”. This is where Vivarail has gotten lucky. The original bogies from the D78 stock “fell to pieces”, as Shooter put it (they were too rigid and suffered cracking on the inconsistent District Line track), and from 2000-03 were replaced with Bombardier bogies (Adtranz, then) that are still in good condition, the same as used on the 1995 Stock on the Northern Line. “The result is a train that is very affordable but it will have a lot of absolutely up-to-date facilities, in terms of the engines and the alternators, the IGBT electronic power control and a number of other features and communications systems,” Shooter said. Conversion Vivarail received the first of the D78 stock on 19 January and the conversion began immediately. All of the existing DC control gear, including cam shaft control and all of the underfloor equipment used on Underground trains, was removed from the driving cars. This will be replaced by two 3L Ford Diesel engines combining to create 400hp for each driving car, plus a modern alternator and inverter with an output of 750v DC, plus a compressor. The trains will also have IGBTs (insulated gate bipolar transistors) made by Strukton Rail in Holland, and while early versions of the D-Train will come with rheostatic braking, Vivarail is looking to fit later models with a braking system that recovers and reuses the energy. “We’ve got some recycled parts clearly, but people really aren’t that bothered about bogies provided they’re unobtrusive and work and the same with the body shells,” Shooter said. “Our principal objective is that when passengers travel in this train they say ‘Isn’t this a fantastic new train?’ That’s our desired end.” Vivarail plans to have its prototype up and running on the test track at Long Marston by June, and approved by the autumn to run out on Network Rail track. Lightweight and low maintenance The D-Train will come with several notable benefits: at 25 tonnes per vehicle in the three-car formation, they will be a lot lighter than other trains (a Class 150 comes in at 35 tonnes). That helps keep fuel consumption low, as do the modern automotive engines, which shut off when the train idles. Shooter has focused on finding ways to “substantially reduce maintenance costs”, such as designing the engine units and bogies to be easily removable and replaceable. He claims the engine units can be swapped out in 10 minutes and Vivarail has also designed a notional depot that would allow the bogies to be swapped very quickly too. After Vivarail has finished overhauling the train, replacing the lights with modern LED lighting, and all the old components, there will be very little other than the bogies and engines that will require maintenance. Shooter says this gives the D-Train a big bonus: maintenance can be kept local to the line it is operating on. “There are quite a few branch lines around the country that are a long way from a maintenance depot. It might make sense to put a ‘mini-depot’ somewhere along the line, because this train does not need to go back to a proper, conventional maintenance depot,” he said. “Now if you think about the fact that you can start to keep these trains local to the line where they operate, it means that you haven’t got to waste a lot of time and money in sending them miles to a maintenance depot. That incurs fuel cost, driver cost, track access cost, and also possibly means Network Rail has to keep a line open at times when it would be more efficient for them to get on and be maintaining it at night. So there are a number of angles there and these trains would be very suitable for that.” Commuter routes, not fast routes Shooter has a particular vision where he can see the D-Train being used. Although he couldn’t go into details, he has been in talks with all of the bidders for the next Northern franchise, but he has not contacted anyone bidding for TransPennine Express. “This would not be the right train for somewhere where there’s going to be a lot of faster running. For example, I am not talking to any bidders for the TPE franchise, because the nature of their runs is quite fast running and this is not the right train for that. What this might do of course, is free up some other faster, older DMUs that can then be redeployed on some of those routes.” The D-Train will have a maximum speed of only 60mph, although it does have relatively good acceleration. Shooter believes this will make it ideal for a route with a lot of station stops. With the different configurations that Vivarail offer for the carriages, it will also be suitable for both long and short routes. Shooter also sees the D-Train as an ideal way to deal with rush-hour commuters. “Take commuting in and out of cities where there’s very heavy crowding on trains that are not going tremendously fast. Because this train is very affordable, one option would be to acquire some just to do a morning trip into the city, park up all day and then bring a load of people out in the evening,” he said. “If it’s not too long a distance what you’d probably do is keep the configuration similar to what they are now, as used on the District Line, and then it’s an efficient way of shifting a lot of people quickly in reasonable circumstances. So that’s one option.” What makes the D-Train ideal for commuter journeys is it is what the old D78 stock was originally designed for. In their original configuration they would come with four doors, making it very efficient in loading and off-loading, reducing station dwell time. However for longer routes, Shooter said that Vivarail will offer alternative configurations with some of the doors taken out to make way for more seating. Getting the Department for Transport on board As promising as the D-Train sounds, it’s hard to imagine it becoming a success without the support of the Department for Transport (DfT), which has been lukewarm on the subject of old District Line stock to say the least – publicly mindful of the potentially bad PR of being seen to replace decrepit Pacers with “London’s cast-offs”. In December a DfT spokesperson told RTM: “There is no government proposal to replace Pacer trains with old London Underground trains. “We are committed to improving services for passengers across the north. We recognise that Pacers fall short of passengers’ expectations, which is why we will be specifically requiring bidders for the next Northern franchise to phase these outdated trains out. These bids must include improved rolling stock. “The industry is best placed to tell us how more modern, better quality trains can be introduced, and it is only right that we look to them as we push ahead with our ambitious plans to transform the north’s rail network.” But Shooter says that things have moved on a lot since then. “We hadn’t been very forthcoming on what we’re doing until relatively recently, so in the absence of knowing what we’re doing, it’s not surprising that people should be sceptical, that’s absolutely fine,” he explained. “What I can say is that we’re now being much more public about what we’re doing and explaining just how much time and money we’ve put into this, which is quite considerable. And of course I’ve been briefing officials at the DfT so that they’re now aware in a great deal of detail what it is that we’re offering to operators.” (Library image of Adrian Shooter) With the rolling stock problems facing the rail network the D-Train could just be the right solution and the right time. But what inspired Shooter in coming up with the scheme in the first place? “I bought some of the last DMUs that were bought in this country, the 172s, which we bought for Chiltern and London Overground. They’re a good train but they’re very expensive,” he said. “So I looked around at what the alternative might be, and the fact that there is going to be, at least for a few years, a shortage of DMUs until electrification catches up. Leasing companies are not going to want to lease something that’s probably got a 40-year life if they can only really see 10 years’ worth of use. So I said to myself, if we could produce something that was affordable, maybe we can fill that gap – so why not do some re-engineering?” Interview by Sam McCaffrey Tell us what you think – have your say below, or email us directly at [email protected] Mick   23/01/2015 at 12:05 What a refreshing attitude from Mr Shooter; cheap and cheerful, an understanding of what the passengers need.

The automation company announced last Wednesday that Sanderink, at the age of 74, will once again be in charge of the company that he set up in 1992 and of which he is still wholly owner. Also read: The Public Prosecution Service is reaching for a heavy means to depose Gerard Sanderink Sanderink’s companies (besides Centric, among others, infrastructure builder Strukton) have been restless for years because of the many changes at the top and the private legal conflicts that the entrepreneur is fighting with his ex-girlfriend. Those involved previously spoke in NRC about the important role that Sanderink’s current girlfriend – the controversial and self-proclaimed cyber expert Rian van Rijbroek – plays. It would, among other things, encourage the departure of several directors. Board members also became frustrated with her involvement in the companies. One of the reasons that the Public Prosecution Service is involved in the case is that many governments are customers of Centric. The Enterprise Chamber must now consider measures that are necessary to ‘guarantee the stability and continuity of Centric’. One of the questions that the Enterprise Chamber must now answer is whether there are reasons to conduct further investigation into the state of affairs at the IT company. At the same time, the Enterprise Section can impose temporary measures as long as the investigation is ongoing. Sanderink may then be temporarily suspended. In a second phase of the procedure, the Enterprise Section must consider whether there has been mismanagement at Centric. The appointed investigators have then completed their report with findings. If mismanagement is established, the Enterprise Section may decide to permanently remove Sanderink from his position as director. The voting rights that the Twente entrepreneur has as owner and with which he is concerned with the appointment of a new director may also be withdrawn.

With specialist knowledge and years of experience, we offer high-quality craftsmanship in concrete repair. Concrete, a widely used material for those looking for a sturdy, massive and relatively cheap solution. Concrete has extremely many advantages compared to other materials, which makes it very interesting to use. Building in an inhabited environment places high demands on the contractors. The building space is almost always limited, the time margin minimal. That is why our work does not lack smart techniques that support and make the construction process possible. Just like professional ways to improve or restore the lifespan and quality of concrete structures. However, concrete can lose its strength if it is compromised. Damage can be caused by aging, fire, implementation or design errors, but also by factors such as the weather or, for example, acid or chlorides. Another common damage pattern is that the reinforcement starts to rust. Due to the expansion of rust, the concrete can be pressed around the reinforcement (cover). It is very important that the concrete is renovated if it no longer meets the requirements. Concrete must always be in good condition to guarantee the (structural) safety of a structure. SMT Betontechniek can sustainably renovate the concrete so that it can last for years. Within Strukton Milieutechniek, we have brought together the inspection, repair, renovation and conservation of concrete structures in a specialized Concrete Repair team. We carry out inspections and repairs, advise on maintenance and realize small and large-scale repairs to concrete structures. We work on quays, bridges, tunnels, underpasses and roads, among other things. We also have experience in carrying out (concrete) maintenance at industrial factory locations. Our knowledge of different types of concrete, such as reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, lightweight concrete and underwater concrete, in combination with knowledge of the various concrete repair techniques, ensures the sustainability of the repair work we carry out. Quality and comfort are central to this, for now and in the future. SMT Betontechniek is fully certified to carry out concrete repairs in accordance with the rules of NEN-EN 1504, CUR recommendation 118 and BRL 3201 part 1 and 2. This means that we can provide aesthetic, technical and constructive concrete repairs. There is also a concrete maintenance expert in our team. We carry out our repair work ourselves. SMT Betontechniek carries out the work itself. We immediately convert advice into suitable solutions. The team is trained from various disciplines so that we can advise and unburden you with our own experts on larger or more complex projects. When concrete is damaged, it must be renovated. First of all, it is important to find out why damage to the concrete could have occurred. It is necessary to find out so that it can be avoided in the future. Our concrete maintenance expert is happy to assist you. We can carry out a repair by means of manual repair, we often repair larger concrete damage by pouring the repair spot or by applying shotcrete. We can also apply the shotcrete in the right color, making the repair virtually invisible. For example, to prevent concrete damage, the use of carbonation-inhibiting liquid-tight coatings is a good solution. This coating protects the concrete against weather influences, among other things.

This means that the Public Prosecution Service has not yet sent a summons. It is still unclear whether the Public Prosecution Service will eventually prosecute Sanderink, according to his lawyer Paul Acda. The Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service (FIOD) raided Strukton in 2019 because of a metro project in the Saudi capital Riyadh. The Dutch construction company was awarded a contract of 1 billion euros for the construction of the metro network in the city. Sanderink is suspected of leading the official bribery of a Saudi prince to get that job. Acda has asked the investigating judge to question several witnesses. They would paint a more complete picture of the Saudi issue than the FIOD.

As a result, no train traffic will be possible until at least the beginning of October 2022. A new forecast will follow in the week of September 12. This forecast is expected to shift further due to the extent of the damage. ProRail inspectors are currently investigating the exact damage together with maintenance contractor Strukton. We are working hard to map the damage from the power outage in Swifterbant and to provide a forecast for the period of recovery. We cannot give a realistic prognosis at this time. We know that no trains will run on the Lelystad - Dronten route until at least the beginning of October, but this is expected to take longer. The period from the beginning of October, which can be seen in travel planners since today, is intended not to give wrong expectations when planning travel in the future. In the week of September 12, we expect to be able to give an initial forecast about how long the recovery will take. The damage is a result of the incident on Friday afternoon, September 2. A high-voltage cable from grid operator TenneT then ended up on the overhead line near Swifterbant. The incident caused an enormous amount of power to pass through our systems in a short period of time. As a result, relay boxes have become defective underground. Cables and switches are burnt out. A lot of equipment damage was caused in both a substation and a switching station. There is also a lot of damage underground that still needs to be investigated. It may be that over a distance of several kilometers all infrastructure for the energy supply and train protection systems must be renewed.

The collision caused havoc, but luckily there were no injuries. It was a traumatic experience for both the bus driver and the train driver. Our thoughts go out to them. An investigation has been carried out into the cause of the accident. It was quite a job, but after four days of hard work, the track at Bergen op zoom has been fully repaired. On Friday morning, October 21, the train service could be restarted. Immediately after the accident, our contractor Strukton set to work together with subcontractors and suppliers to get an overall picture of the damage and what was needed to repair it as quickly as possible. The damage only really became apparent after the bus was towed away. Over a length of 250 metres, all rails and sleepers were broken. In addition, there was a lot of oil on the track. A small repair was also necessary to the overhead line. But the biggest challenge was still the logistical operation to have enough people and material available in a short time. People from all over the country have traveled to Zeeland to participate. We would therefore like to thank everyone who contributed to this for the hard work that has been done these days. And a special thanks to the driving school owner who made his terrain available to us. Unfortunately, we need more time to repair the track in Bergen op Zoom. As a result, no trains will run between Bergen op Zoom and Roosendaal until 07:30 on Friday morning. Previously, the hope was that train traffic could be restarted on Thursday afternoon, but we already indicated that this was not certain. The work is large and therefore requires time. Contractor Strukton is busy repairing broken sleepers and 300 meters of rail, among other things. A completely new level crossing must also be installed. Consult travel planner Train traffic between Bergen op Zoom and Vlissingen largely resumed yesterday evening. Train traffic between Bergen op Zoom and Roosendaal will remain blocked until at least Thursday afternoon, October 20. Buses replace rail traffic between these two cities. In order to properly investigate the accident, we initially had to supply power over a large part of the overhead line. Also at Bergen op Zoom station. Therefore, the station could temporarily not be used at all. Now that is possible again, so that a large part of the trains can run to Zeeland. It is expected that we will be working on repairing the track at the accident site until at least Thursday afternoon. Among other things, a new level crossing installation must be installed and the soil must be cleaned up. Diesel was released during the collision. In addition, a piece of track is damaged: that must first be repaired. The rail contractor has mapped out the damage and shared an initial prognosis. The repair work is expected to take at least three days. There is currently no train traffic between Bergen op Zoom and Roosendaal. We are evacuating the passengers from the train. The rail contractor is on site to assess the damage and draw up a plan for the repair. We are currently unable to indicate when trains will be able to run on this route again. John Voppen, CEO at ProRail, responded to the incident: ""This could have been a dramatic day for the railway. Several people have had an angel on their shoulders. And yet this must be a traumatic experience for both the driver and the driver . Our thoughts go out to them in the first instance. Our colleagues will ensure that the track becomes passable again. That is where the focus is now. In addition, we want to get to the bottom of how this could have happened. That is why we will also fully participate in the investigation.""

Here you can see how a huge tunnel box weighing millions of kilos is pushed under the A2 at the Batadorp junction in Eindhoven.   Earlier this week, the municipality and Strukton described the precise positioning of the tunnel box as a real masterpiece. The job was preceded by more than a year of preparation together with ‘Rijkswaterstaat‘ (Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management). Joystick The tunnel’s components were placed under the A2 with millimetre precision using special machines controlled by a joystick. In total, some 200 men are working on the job. Traffic pressure The tunnel should make it easier for freight traffic to leave the large GDC industrial estate in Acht. This business park is growing rapidly. The connection between GDC and the Brainport Industries Campus and Eindhoven Airport should also be improved. The tunnel should also reduce the amount of traffic at the Batadorp junction and the Antony Fokkerweg. Work It will take another year before traffic can use the new subway. First the tunnel has to be finished and the roads around it constructed. Due to the work, there may be considerable traffic jams in the near future.

54,https://www.prorail.nl/nieuws/prorail-op-pole-position,2022-09-05,www.prorail.nl,Newspaper/Magazine,Prorail on pole position,1,"ProRail and NS on pole position News Published on September 5, 2022 Professional work prior to the Dutch Grand Prix has ensured that a train came to Zandvoort almost every 5 minutes this weekend. Tens of thousands of train passengers have arrived safely and on time at the track and have been brought home. During the race days, employees of the traffic control posts in Alkmaar and Amsterdam monitored the situation on the track for days. They had to intervene a few times due to unexpected malfunctions. They were resolved in record time. Our incident responders were also constantly on standby. They were on pole position along the track but hardly used their safety car. There were no significant incidents. The crowd management for which NS was responsible also worked well. It was extremely busy at the stations along the Amsterdam – Zandvoort aan Zee route from time to time. The clear signage and the many colleagues who steered fans in the right direction with a smile ensured that no panic broke out anywhere. In general, everyone is enthusiastic about the railway. As one of the travelers exclaimed: ""It's going like a train!"" Mirjam van Velthuizen, Chief Financial Officer of ProRail, has had an exciting Formula 1 afternoon. “It's fantastic to be part of this event. I have great admiration for our railway performance: hundreds of trains, three days in a row. And tens of thousands of cheerful fans who come by train and then relax to the circuit via the event platforms, the widened stairs and the 'events bridge'. It is wonderful to see that all this has been achieved through the dedication and expertise within our company.” Harro Homan, regional director of Randstad North, is also very enthusiastic. “Last year we ran twelve trains per hour for the first time. Then it went very well, of course, but the stands were 'only' 75% full. This year it was full house. And that also meant many more train passengers.” The NS said that from time to time it was very busy in Haarlem and Amsterdam, but that the crowd managers did an excellent job. Harro Homan: “There were no unsafe situations anywhere. Of course, the travelers also took into account the crowds in advance. They behaved very disciplined. But they also had great days!” Those twelve trains per hour did not just run. Behind the scenes, a lot of hard work has gone into making Zandvoort accessible. And so the race for ProRail started long before the Dutch Grand Prix weekend. Rails to the race Train traffic has been hampered a few times by disruptions. On Friday morning there was a broken down train and on Saturday a bus crashed into a railway viaduct. This caused some delays on the track. “The breakdown teams of contractors Strukton and VolkerRail were present in no time to ensure that the track was safe for use again,” Mirjam van Velthuizen looks back. “Later in the day it turned out that a beam had ended up on the overhead line at Sloterdijk. This incident was also resolved quite quickly. The traveler hardly noticed.” This Formula 1 race will be held annually in Zandvoort for the time being. ProRail will therefore continue to work on this in the coming years. “We now know for sure that we can handle this together,” says Harro Homan. “But there was a huge amount of events this weekend: Hiswa te water, Elrow Town Festival, the Ajax-Cambuur match, the Kensington concert… Hopefully next year we can persuade event organizers to skip this weekend . Then there is more room to allow train traffic in the rest of the country to run normally. In any case, we have delivered craftsmanship again. And we will do that again next year.

The contractor and rail manager made this known in response to a report from the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate, which states that the safety culture at the shunting yard is not up to standard. “We endorse the need to improve safety at the Kijfhoek shunting yard,” says ProRail spokesperson Coen van Kranenburg. The work at Kijfhoek was halted by ILT on 19 July following an accident on 15 June. Then the lorry derailed when it collided with a tank wagon. There was a flammable substance in the wagon, but there was no danger because it was not damaged. It was the fourth incident in a short time. In an investigation into the accident, the ILT says that both ProRail and Strukton Rail did not comply with safety instructions. According to the regulator, the problem is structural: deviations from the safety procedures would have occurred more often. The Inspectorate stated that there were insufficient guarantees in the field of supervision, management and evaluations to ensure that people could work safely and that the railways remained safe. This violates the Railways Act. ProRail and Strukton are therefore required by ILT to make a thorough analysis of the safety risks and take measures to guarantee safety before work can be restarted. The rail manager says that it is in talks with contractors such as Strukton Rail and with ILT about the possibilities of improving the safety culture at Kijfhoek. The Municipality of Zwijndrecht also plays an important role in this process, says Van Kranenburg. “The municipality is very critical, and rightly so. We will therefore keep the municipality closely involved in this process.” Strukton Rail also says it wants to improve safety at Kijfhoek. A spokesperson for the rail company says it finds it unacceptable that Strukton employees have not complied with safety instructions at Kijfhoek. “Deviating behavior in which we do not comply with safety instructions or agreed work processes is something we do not want and cannot accept,” says the spokesperson. “We are therefore constantly working on increasing our safety awareness. Sometimes we do that by learning from a deviation or incident.” The railway company indicates that it will use the intervention of the Inspectorate to improve the safety culture. “We have informed our employees and we are tightening up the procedures. Consultations with ProRail and ILT have also started for this.” The spokesperson cannot yet say what ProRail will actually do to improve the situation: “ILT has said: it cannot go on like this. We agree with that. Now we are conducting all kinds of studies to see what steps we can take to improve safety.” What is clear is that the mound system is outdated: “It must indeed be replaced. It is in the planning, but money must be available for this. We will discuss this with ILT.” According to the ProRail spokesperson, the consequences for freight transporters of stopping work are manageable: “We had discussions with the transporters about this on Wednesday. We have the consequences under control so far. The contractor also plays a role in this and they have also let us know that this is working well.” ProRail does not yet know when the work can be restarted. “We have not set a deadline for this. We must first have confidence that all employees can perform their work safely and that it is also safe for the environment.” The spokesman for Strukton Rail agrees: ""Regular activities will only be resumed once all parties involved are convinced that the workplace is safe for all employees.""

This achieved a resolution of close to 1mm ground sampling distance (GSD) and an image footprint of 12m x 9m from a flight height of 10m distance. The data has been used to create a 3D mesh of the structure.  Dutch company EyeFly BV is one of the few fully certified operators of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or ‘drones’) in the Netherlands. The company has obtained all the permits regarding the commercial use of drones as well as additional certificates for flying in congested areas and controlled airspace. EyeFly is focused on performing inspections and mapping (2D and 3D models) using aircraft that have been tested by the Netherlands Aerospace Centre and registered in the aviation records. ​​ The company offers a specialist level of expertise and skills in infrastructure, construction, geoinformation and surveying.

By Srivani Venna Strukton Systems has secured a contract from infrastructure manager ProRail to install the ATB Vv train protection system on the Brabant Route from Rotterdam to Venlo and the A2 corridor from Alkmaar to Maastricht in the Netherlands. The ATB Vv train protection system automatically stops trains reaching a red signal at speeds higher than 40 km/hour and increases the safety level. It also stops trains approaching a red signal at speeds lower than 40 km/hour. Funding for the launch will be provided by the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment. The existing traditional ATB system is expected to be replaced with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). The Brabant route will be installed with ATB Vv as freight trains will frequently be redirected over this route during the construction of a third track between Emmerich and Oberhausen in Germany.

The new workshop has five tracks and modern facilities. Strukton Rail uses three of these tracks for maintenance of rail machines and locomotives, among other things. In addition, the company builds in train protection systems and overhauls train equipment and other rail systems. Strukton Rail supplies products and services for electrical systems in trains, some of which are installed in Zutphen. Director Aike Schoots of Strukton Rail: “It is special for the rail sector to see private companies investing in trains with their own investments and thus creating a better product for passengers in competition.” Strukton Rail already had a train workshop in Zutphen, but this workshop had become too small for the increasingly larger machines. Schoots: ""In this new workshop we can also maintain trains in times of snow or other problems."" The railway in Zutphen connects well with the national railway arteries and also the international railway. Strukton Bouw built the workshop and took care of the layout of the site. Strukton Rail built the yard and the track in the workshop. Ariva uses the other two tracks for the maintenance of the 38 trains of the Vechtdal Lines and the Achterhoek Rivierenland region. With this, the company is competing with maintenance company NedTrain of the Dutch Railways. Director Anne Hettinga of Arriva: “I think this collaboration is the next step in the entire evolution that is taking place within the public transport sector. Twelve years ago and all those years before that, maintenance was only done by NedTrain without competition.” Years ago, Arriva was the first party to outsource maintenance to another party. The transport company did this at maintenance company Voith. Arriva will now maintain the trains itself. Hettinga: “We expect to be able to do this at at least the same level of quality and safety for even more competitive prices. This is a good result of market forces.” Marieke van Gompel Would you like unlimited reading?

The POSS system monitors the condition of a rail object remotely. As a result, maintenance can be carried out more efficiently. After installation, more than 1,850 of the most crucial points on the Dutch rail network will be equipped with this monitoring system. Strukton Systems developed the POSS system ten years ago. The objects for which up-to-date information is provided remotely are points, axle counters and level crossings. POSS is the most widely used switch monitoring system in the world. Because various sensors can be connected to the system, POSS can, for example, also perform wheel quality measurements in addition to checking points. POSS registers everything that deviates from the standard and therefore recognizes deviations before they lead to a malfunction. The maintenance organization only needs to take action as soon as a deviation appears. The material is therefore only maintained when the condition requires it and therefore saves costs. In the event of a deviation, a notification is sent via GPRS or Ethernet. This notification takes place via e-mail or text message. The user of the system can view the current condition of the track material via the internet. The historical data on the condition of the material is always available. The data can be used for analysis or reporting. Strukton Systems will start the installation as soon as possible. The points must be equipped with the monitoring system at the beginning of 2013.

The agreement is intended to give further substance to the covenant that was concluded with the contractors in 2013. The contracts now have a term of ten years, where previously it was five years. This is to stimulate long-term investments. Maintenance based on the new contracts will start in the 'Gelre2' contract areas with Asset Rail, Strukton Rail in the 'Wadden' contract area, The Hague contract area with BAM Rail and the Twente contract area with VolkerRail. The new contracts differ from the previous PGO contracts and are mainly aimed at prevention and quality improvement, according to BAM Rail. Stricter rules for, among other things, fault recovery, the number of faults and safety values ​​have been included. “On the other hand, the contracts stimulate a quality circle of continuous learning and improvement.” According to the rail contractor, this should ultimately result in a continuous improvement process resulting in a more robust track. An important change in the current contracts compared to the previous agreements is that they now have a term of ten years. Previously this was five years. The idea behind the expansion is that it should stimulate contractors and make it possible to make more investments for the long term. In training of personnel and infrastructure, for example. The contract form will be further developed in the coming period, it is stated. ProRail checks the quality of the track during the term of the contracts. Since 2008, rail management has been working with contracts based on performance-based maintenance. This arose from the wish of the Nma and the European Commission to put rail maintenance out to public tender, as was already common practice in other construction sectors. Maintenance in eleven contract areas is now carried out via the PGO method (public tender). In the remaining areas, the classic OPC method (no competition) is currently still used. Those areas will be put out to tender until 2018. Do you want unlimited reading?

This is the conclusion of the Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate in an investigation into the near-collision. According to the ILT, the train driver's error in judgment when passing a red signal, together with an error in the planning, could have had major consequences. Also, too few measures have been taken to reduce the risk of an STS passage (stop signal passage). On 25 April, an NS sprinter almost collided with a Strukton Rail freight train coming from the opposite direction. The slow train was on its way to Breukelen, the freight train ran from Maarssen via Utrecht Central Station to Roosendaal. The driver of the sprinter passed a red signal, but applied emergency braking when he saw the freight train approaching. Because he intervened, the trains did not collide. No one was injured in the incident. However, the infrastructure was damaged and train traffic was delayed. The Inspectorate states that ProRail's traffic control did not report the incident correctly. The railway manager reported that it was an STS passage without risk of collision, while in reality there was a near-collision. According to ILT, the near-collision in Utrecht corresponds to previous serious incidents such as the train collisions at Amsterdam Westerpark in 2012, in Barendrecht in 2009 and at Amsterdam Central Station in 2004. For example, the train collision in Amsterdam also involved a timetable that did not comply with the planning standards and then went unnoticed by ProRail. Several people were injured in the train collisions in Amsterdam Westerpark and Barendrecht. One person was also killed in both cases. Several people were injured at Amsterdam CS. ILT states that ProRail in particular has not learned enough from these incidents, especially those in 2009 and 2004. Shortly after the incident in Utrecht, ProRail took measures to prevent a recurrence. Driving on a single track by the local train on the Breukelen-Utrecht CS route has been removed from the timetable. This allowed trains from opposite directions to approach each other on the same track. The passed signal is also equipped with Automatic Train Influencing, Improved version (ATB Vv), so that safety now depends less on the actions and observations of a train driver. The ATB-EG automatic protection system did not intervene because the slow train was traveling at approximately 40 kilometers per hour when it passed the signal. ATB-EG only intervenes at speeds higher than 40 kilometers per hour. The now installed ATB Vv also intervenes at speeds below 40 kilometers per hour. The near-train collision in Utrecht is included in the stricter supervision that the Inspectorate has instituted in response to the Amsterdam Westerpark train collision.

The rail sleepers will be replaced between Ophemstraat and Reigerstraat on the track in the direction of Wavre. For this work, main contractor Strukton Rail had the Strabag renewal train come from Germany to Oud-Heverlee. It removes the old sleepers (biblock) from 1992 from under the tracks and replaces them with sleepers in one piece (monoblock). It concerns a 1600-metre stretch from level crossing 7 (Ophemstraat) to level crossing 8 (Reigerstraat). You can see how that works in this video. At the same time, Infrabel is carrying out other works.

The dust-free unloading train (SALT) was used for the first time during the recent track renewal between Almelo and Mariënberg. With the help of the SALT, Strukton Rail brought 56,000 tons of new ballast into work in a healthy, safer and efficient way. During the unloading of ballast, dust is created that is harmful to railway workers and local residents. The new ballast train is intended to enable rail workers to work in a healthy and sound way from a health and safety point of view. The newly developed installation on the train precipitates the dust with water spray. Wagon owner Voestalpine Railpro and ProRail worked intensively with sector parties to develop this new installation. During the development of the SALT, the rail workers were asked to think about solutions that would make the unloading of ballast with the voestalpine Railpro ballast train safer and less stressful. These have been included in the final design. The unloading of the train is now hydraulically controlled and operated by remote control. Lighting has also been installed on the wagons. According to the inventors, this entails 'an entirely new method of unloading ballast'. Rail workers followed a training to learn how to unload with the SALT. The test was put to the test in Mariënberg. The response to the dust reduction and the new working method was positive. Voestalpine Railpro is now going to convert all its ballast trains into new low-dust unloading trains. Do you want unlimited reading?

Argument: get rid of bankers. 'Expensively paid system analysts are not backpackers who come to smoke weed for a weekend. But they do contribute to the same problem. The people of Amsterdam no longer know their own city – and are getting less and less chance to do so because they can no longer live there. The charm offensive with which the financial City-aan-de-Amstel is promoted may not be such a good idea. Why don't the remaining European countries concentrate the London exodus on one European city? – someone recently suggested. The City derives its appeal mainly from the fact that all international banks, insurance companies and the like are located together. The race of European capitals for a few crumbs of the cake is then rather counterproductive. Channel everything into one place and you really have an alternative. Only Frankfurt, seat of the European Central Bank, could compete with London.' A sprinter's Porsche Do you remember Brazil? Dafne Schippers wanted to win everything at the Olympic Games, but she only won silver in the 200 meters. Now she is taking revenge and, more muscular than ever, she takes bronze in the 100 meters at the World Cup. That's great, because not even her distance. The reason for the success is a new trainer, say connoisseurs, and her tendency to ignore the outside world, according to de Volkskrant: 'The contrast between the athletics track and the photo studio is enormous. Everything can be polished in advertising campaigns. Schippers hung on meters-high posters in numerous cities of the world, stripped of every unevenness by the wonderful technique of digital image processing: the symbol of athletic perfection in the eyes of its sponsor. 'Schippers seems to be able to separate these different worlds better this year than in the run-up to the Games. The sponsored 2015 Volkswagen Polo may have been swapped for a sponsored Porsche Macan (recommended retail price 131,000 euros), but she has recognized the relativity of glitter and glamour.' Porsche from a healthcare entrepreneur Nice, the FD is also becoming more and more like the Telegraaf. This headline would not have been out of place in the newspaper of the awake and especially angry Netherlands 'Care money for a Porsche.' The text: 'According to the Public Prosecution Service, the director of a care institution for mildly disabled youngsters spent millions of euros in care money in a few years' time on luxury holidays, cars and apartments.' Who is it about? To Darryl Nooitmeer (38) and to his girlfriend. Here in the photo: This Mr. Nooitmeer pulls care institution Vivence, which he takes over from bankruptcy, completely empty with an extreme rent and transferring money to himself and family members. The FD continues: 'While Darryl is still negotiating this settlement, he will become the sole director of ZSV. On paper it is a foundation, but in fact it is a family business. Father, mother, cousins ​​and other (in-law) relatives are on the payroll, without the rest of the staff knowing about it.' Another passage: 'On his Facebook page you can see where that money went. Numerous photos bear witness to luxurious holidays: Darryl playing golf, Darryl with (girlfriend) Dominique in the jungle. Darryl in a helicopter over Hollywood. 'We already found that he was often on holiday as a director,' says a former employee of ZSV. There is no holiday for Darryl for the time being. He will be held until December 8. The FD has made several attempts to ask Darryl for a response. Shortly after the FD had sent a message to its Facebook page, photos on it were removed. There was no response. Almost all of the family members drive a luxury lease car. At the expense of ZSV. Champion lease driver is director Darryl N. himself. He drives a Porsche 911 Targa 4S, an Audi A8 and a BMW i8, each with a purchase price of at least one ton. 'Of course we as staff sometimes asked questions about Darryl's cars. For example, he once drove up to Amsterdam in a car with a driver. But his story was that he had a lot of money because he had sold his ICT company with a lot of profit,' says a former manager of ZSV. The Foundation has since been declared bankrupt. The turnover in 2014 amounted to € 5.4 million, the profit was over 5 tons. Orange coins We can't pay with it in the store, but it does breed that nostalgic golden feeling.

The reigning European champion won bronze in the sold-out Olympic Stadium with 6636 points, an improvement on her Dutch record. Data from at least one hundred thousand lease drivers on the street Have you been wrong on the road? Your boss can check it all out. Personal data of at least one hundred thousand lease drivers are on the street. The security of more than fifty leasing companies was so poor that names, addresses, lease contracts and even fines could be traced. Banks agree with Strukton Strukton's financiers are demanding more control over the construction company. Partly at the insistence of house banks ABN Amro, Rabobank and NIBC, the construction company will have its own supervisory board this year. This can be deduced from the recently published annual report. Furthermore, new financing has been agreed, but only until June next year. This means that Strukton will have to make new credit agreements relatively quickly. With a turnover of €1.9 billion, Strukton is one of the largest Dutch construction companies. In the Netherlands, the company is active in rail and tunnel construction, among other things, and built the A2 tunnel in Maastricht. Abroad, Strukton is involved in projects such as the construction of the metro in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. Be kind to Baudet Baudet is a relief.

70,https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/artikel/4466311/een-giftige-cocktail-vier-dode-kinderen-paniek-en-house-cards,2018-10-29,www.rtlnieuws.nl,Newspaper/Magazine,A poisonous cocktail four dead kids panic and house cards,1,"Een giftige cocktail: vier dode kinderen, paniek en House of Cards RTL Nieuws heeft zich na het ongeval in Oss op 20 september verdiept in de toelating van de stint op de Nederlandse wegen. En de manier waarop het ministerie daarna de stint verbood. Dit is onze reconstructie. De overheid is in 2011 gewaarschuwd voor de grote problemen die konden ontstaan met de invoering van de 'bijzondere bromfiets', zoals de elektronische bolderkar stint. Geen toezicht op veiligheid, geen controle, geen handhaving, geen zicht op de ontwikkeling van dit soort voertuigen. Daarom brak op de dag van het dramatisch ongeluk met de stint grote paniek uit op het ministerie en bij de inspectie. De reconstructie van bestuurlijk falen en een politieke cover-up in zes delen. 20 september. Een ongeluk op het spoor in Oss. De bestuurster van een stint raakt de macht over de bolderkar kwijt. Vier kinderen komen om het leven. Er raakt nog een kind zwaargewond, net als de begeleidster. In Oss en heel Nederland is er verdriet en ontreddering. Op het ministerie van Infrastructuur en Waterstaat (IenW) en bij de Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport (ILT) dringt direct door dat er een probleem is. ""Er ontstond grote paniek,"" zeggen meerdere bronnen. In het verleden zijn inschattingsfouten gemaakt en er zijn waarschuwingen genegeerd. Er zijn documenten achtergehouden en er zijn geen duidelijke regels gemaakt. Er ontstaat paniek. Het eigen falen van ministerie en de inspectie staat in het geheugen gebrand, door de parlementaire enquête naar de Fyra. ''Dat ding moet onmiddellijk de weg af"", zegt de senior beleidsmedewerker Verkeersveiligheid op die eerste dag tegen zijn bazen. Minister, secretaris-generaal, directeur-generaal, directeur, beleidsmedewerkers en juristen werken vanaf dat moment aan een witwasoperatie: al het vuil uit het verleden moet zo snel mogelijk, maar goed gedoseerd de deur uit, zodat het niet te veel opvalt.  Er moet snel gehandeld worden, zodat fouten uit het verleden zich niet tegen de huidige minister en ambtenaren keren. Er is voorlopig geen bewijs dat de stint in Oss iets mankeerde. Maar alles wijst erop dat er redenen gevonden moeten worden om de stint zo snel mogelijk van de weg te halen. Ook als dat bestuurlijk of juridisch helemaal niet kan, omdat de bewijsvoering ontbreekt. Om dat mogelijk te maken is gemanipuleerd met bewijsvoering, om voldoende 'twijfel' te zaaien. Dit blijkt uit een reconstructie die RTL Nieuws op basis van geheime stukken, openbare documenten en gesprekken met direct betrokkenen en klokkenluiders heeft gemaakt. Veel informatie is jarenlang niet gegeven aan de Tweede Kamer; ook nu zijn er nog talloze documenten waarover het parlement niet is geïnformeerd, blijkt uit ons onderzoek. Al op die fatale 20ste september maken juristen een 'concept-besluit' om de stint van de weg te halen. Om 16.30 uur ligt een eerste versie klaar. ""Het was stuitend"", zegt een klokkenluider tegen RTL Nieuws. ''Eigen falen toedekken, alleen maar naar anderen wijzen, proberen het de fabrikant in de schoenen te schuiven, tijd kopen met een onderzoek. En geen enkel gevoel voor de grote problemen die dit weer veroorzaakt bij scholen en de kinderopvang."" Het ministerie erkent dat dit document toen al op tafel lag. Het was bedoeld om een 'handelingsperspectief' voor de minister te schetsen. ''Later op de dag bleek dat er geen informatie was om op dat moment tot schorsing over te gaan."" ''Het is een giftige cocktail"", zegt een goed ingevoerde waarnemer. ''Dode kinderen. Alle emoties die dat losmaakt. Een zwakke minister. Een slecht functionerende inspectie."" Wat volgt is een politiek kat-en-muisspel met informatie. House of Cards in Den Haag. De dag na het ongeluk in Oss meldt minister Cora van Nieuwenhuizen aan de Tweede Kamer dat er geen informatie is dat stints onveilig zijn. Achter de schermen is iets anders gaande dan de minister op dat moment doet voorkomen. De Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport (ILT) is al direct betrokken bij het politieonderzoek naar het ongeval, omdat de ILT onderzoek doet naar veilig vervoer en ongelukken op het spoor. Uit ons onderzoek blijkt dat de ILT er op 20 september opeens achter komt dat deze inspectie zelf ook verantwoordelijk was voor het toezicht op de stint, na een telefoontje van een andere toezichthouder, de Nederlandse Voedsel en Waren Autoriteit, om 12.33 uur. ''Na mijn vraag of het voertuig een kentekenplaat had, kreeg ik het antwoord dat het was goedgekeurd door de RDW (Rijksdienst Wegverkeer)."" Conclusie: ''Waarop ik heb aangegeven dat het dan voor ILT is."" Op dat moment drong bij de inspectie door dat zij zelf toezicht hadden moeten houden. De inspecteur alarmeert het afdelingshoofd van de afdeling Markttoezicht. De ILT heeft al die jaren geen toezicht gehouden. Daarom gelast de top van de inspectie die dag om 15.00 uur dat een onderzoek wordt ingesteld naar het 'product stint', naar 'informatie van en rondom het verkeersproduct' en 'naar alles wat daaromheen relevant lijkt': ''In dit stadium wordt het van belang geacht direct te handelen."" Van Nieuwenhuizen meldt op 21 september het parlement niet dat dit productonderzoek door de ILT is ingesteld. Het ministerie zegt afgelopen zaterdagavond in een formele reactie dat de minister niet wist van dit onderzoek: ''Het was geen onderwerp van gesprek met de minister en derhalve is het niet vermeld in de Kamerbrief."" De inspectie laat juist weten dat, hoewel afstemming formeel niet nodig is, bij een ernstig ongeluk als in Oss het ministerie wel op de hoogte wordt gebracht. ''Uiteraard wordt het ministerie in zo'n geval wel geïnformeerd."" De minister maakt in de brief van 21 september ook niet duidelijk dat zij op de dag van het ongeluk al een verbod op de stint onderzocht. Ze maakt dan wel de eerste stukken openbaar die de Tweede Kamer daarvóór niet kreeg. Die vrijdagavond maken topambtenaren van het ministerie een WhatsApp-groep aan, voor 'eventuele ontwikkelingen dit weekend'. Krap een week later, op woensdag 26 september, blijkt dat de inspectie sowieso aankoerst op een nader onderzoek. Ook als er geen informatie opduikt dat de stint onveilig is. Dit blijkt uit wat een inspecteur opschrijft, na een gesprek met de Dienst Wegverkeer (RDW), die de stint eerder keurde: ''Hiermee staat voor ILT de mogelijkheid open om een ander gecertificeerd instituut te vragen andere stints objectief te onderzoeken."" Zijn teamleider concludeert op dezelfde dag dat een instituut 'op korte termijn het onderzoek naar de stint als product' moet gaan bekijken. In reactie op het onderzoek van RTL Nieuws laat de inspectie ons zaterdagavond weten: ''Al direct nadat door de ILT onderzoek was ingesteld, was op basis van de eerste observaties van de betrokken ILT-inspecteurs duidelijk dat voor het verdere onderzoek externe technische expertise nodig zou zijn."" Op maandag 24 september, vier dagen na het ongeval, staat vast dat er een extern onderzoek komt, dat naar verwachting maanden zal duren. ''De ILT heeft vanaf maandag 24 september bezien welke onderzoeksinstituten geëquipeerd zouden zijn om de technische onderzoeken uit te voeren."" Daarmee was feitelijk het lot van de stint bezegeld. Het op de weg laten van de stint tijdens zo'n onderzoek naar de veiligheid, lijkt politiek en bestuurlijk uitgesloten. Het aansturen op een aanvullend onderzoek heeft alle kenmerken van een cover-up. De beslissing wordt genomen voordat het NFI een dag later, op donderdag 26 september 'bewijs' vindt dat er problemen zouden kunnen zijn. Nou ja, bewijs… Vorige week meldde RTL Nieuws al dat het ministerie en de ILT selectief citeerden uit dat onderzoek van NFI; dat er slechts met een klein percentage stints een probleem zou kunnen zijn, werd weggelaten. Ook dat dit volgens het NFI eenvoudig te verhelpen viel, werd niet vermeld. Onder druk van de Kamer gaf de minister het stuk een dag later vrij, maar ze vertelde niet waarom niet het hele verhaal was verteld. Ze zei slechts dat er een beeld ontstond dat er sprake was van een onvolledige weergave van feiten, en dat die verwarring niet de bedoeling was. Wat in de officiële NFI-rapportage nergens wordt vermeld, is dat een ILT-inspecteur aanwezig was bij de 'quick scan' naar het onderzoek en dat onderzoek beïnvloedde. De ILT-inspecteur dus, die onvoldoende technische kennis had, en bewijsvoering zocht dat een stint 'op hol' kon slaan, zoals hij later zou schrijven. Het NFI wil geen antwoord geven op onze vraag waarom in het verslag niet staat dat het onderzoek samen met een ILT-inspecteur is gedaan. Het NFI zou het onderzoek uitvoeren voor het strafrechtelijk onderzoek, zodat later de verongelukte stint daarmee kon worden onderzocht. Maar de ILT had een 'quick scan' en een 'werkhypothese' nodig voor het eigen productonderzoek, om de stint van de weg te kunnen halen. Het onderzoek werd gekaapt. Daarmee legt de ILT een rookgordijn en stelt in officiële stukken dat de inspectie door de politie (de opdrachtgever) is geïnformeerd over de resultaten van het NFI-onderzoek, alsof er geen bemoeienis was met dat onderzoek. Het wegpoetsen van – eigen – vingerafdrukken. Het NFI wijst er in de rapportage nog wel fijntjes op dat bij het vervolgonderzoek een rechter-commissaris vooraf deskundigen moet aanwijzen. Het ministerie noemde de quick-scan en de werkhypothese 'verkennend technisch onderzoek'. Vrijwel ieder onderdeel van het feitenrelaas van de ILT, op basis waarvan de stint op 1 oktober werd verboden, blijkt niet te kloppen. Dat geldt bijvoorbeeld voor het gebruikte soldeer in de stint, dat volgens de ILT zou kunnen smelten. Het is de suggestie dat er iets gevaarlijks is, maar dat is onzin. Alle inhoudelijke weerleggingen van de fabrikant, waar de ILT wel over beschikte, worden in het 'feitenrelaas' óf niet vermeld, of doelbewust verdraaid. Terwijl de teamleider van ILT exact beschrijft wat het verweer is. In het nog vertrouwelijke gespreksverslag van 29 en 30 september heeft de jurist van ILT die tegenwerpingen zoveel mogelijk weggelaten. Veel documenten waarop de minister zich baseerde bij haar besluit om de stint van de weg te halen, zijn geheim. Wie preciezer kijkt, snapt waarom. Het gaat om 'persoonlijke waarnemingen' van een medewerker van Strukton, waar Strukton zichzelf van distantieert. Ook is er een onderzoek van een adviesbureau over incidenten met een stint in Delfzijl. Dat onderzoek blijkt te bestaan uit interviews en is geen technisch onderzoek. Ten slotte schermden minister en ILT in het feitenrelaas met een proces-verbaal van bevindingen naar aanleiding van een incident met een stint in Amsterdam; het gaat om dit document. Wat daarna gebeurt, lijkt voer voor de Rijksrecherche. Op 20 september – de dag van Oss – doet een medewerkster van een kinderopvang in Amsterdam bij de politie telefonisch melding van 'rem en stopproblemen' met stints. Ruim een week later, op 28 september, belt een brigadier van de politie Oost-Brabant. De medewerkster vertelt, volgens het proces-verbaal: een stint zou bij het loslaten van het gas geen vaart minderen, de rem zou onvoldoende werken en de bolderkar zou door de sleutel eruit te halen tot stilstand zijn gebracht. Op zaterdag 29 september schrijft de ILT-inspecteur dat hij wordt gebeld door zijn afdelingshoofd die over deze melding zegt dat een stint 'op hol zou zijn geslagen'. Het lijkt de druppel voor de inspectie. Het is de trigger voor spoedoverleg met stint-baas Edwin Renzen, op die zaterdag 29 september. Dit is belangrijk en kan niet wachten, laat de ILT weten. Renzen wordt door de ILT geconfronteerd met het 'op hol slaan' van een stint. Het keert ook terug in een volgend spoedoverleg, op zondag. Renzen herkent zich niet in de melding, want zijn bedrijf was betrokken bij de afhandeling van het incident. Renzen spreekt de directrice van de kinderopvang. Ook die herkent zich niet in de weergave. De directrice laat de ILT die zondagavond weten dat het niet klopt: ''Wat jullie doen is niet onze intentie. Er zijn geen grote incidenten geweest. Voor zover er een verklaring is, trekken wij die in."" De ILT wijst door naar de politie. Ook het ministerie wordt op zondagavond 30 september op twee manieren geïnformeerd dat het proces-verbaal niet deugt en van tafel moet. Op 1 oktober om 11.00 uur laat de kinderopvang formeel aan de politie weten dat de verklaring moet worden ingetrokken. En als dat niet wordt gedaan, zal een aanvullende verklaring moeten worden opgenomen, waarin het proces-verbaal sterk zal worden genuanceerd. Ook de suggestie van het op hol slaan moet er uit. De betrokken politiemedewerker zegt dat hij een aanvullende verklaring zal opnemen en dat hij de ILT zal informeren. Die avond zal de minister de stint van de weg laten halen, mede op basis van een proces-verbaal dat onjuist is. Op 3 oktober sluit de politie Oost-Brabant het proces-verbaal, als het officieel wordt overgedragen aan de ILT. 'Aldus naar waarheid opgemaakt'. De aanvullende verklaring staat er niet in; ook niet dat de melding wordt ingetrokken en genuanceerd. Als de Tweede Kamer de minister schriftelijk vraagt of haar ministerie bemoeienis had met deze gang van zaken, antwoordt ze dat de ILT hier contact over had met de politie. Wat de minister er niet bij vertelt, is dat een seniorjurist van haar ministerie voor het kort geding op 18 oktober schriftelijk bij de kinderopvang vraagt om de oorspronkelijke verklaring tóch te mogen gebruiken. Nee, zegt de kinderopvang. In ieder geval niet zonder de aanvullende verklaring. Tijdens het kort geding zwijgt de landsadvocaat wijselijk over het proces-verbaal. Ná het kort geding probeert de jurist van het ministerie het nogmaals: mag de oorspronkelijke verklaring dan worden gebruikt voor het debat van de minister met de Tweede Kamer, op donderdag 1 november? Nee, zegt de kinderopvang. Niet zonder de aanvullende verklaring. Dit weekeinde laat het ministerie RTL Nieuws weten dat er geen aanvullende verklaring bij de politie is. ''Een aanvullende verklaring is ons dus niet bekend."" Nee, maar de informatie daarover wel. Vanaf zondagavond 30 september, blijkt uit ons onderzoek. Als de minister de stint per 2 oktober van de weg haalt, wordt gezegd dat de fabrikant wijzigingen doorvoerde die hij had moeten melden. En dat hij die had moeten laten toetsen. Maar dat staat juist niet in de beschikking die de fabrikant in november 2011 van het ministerie kreeg. De stint kreeg in 2014 een zwaardere accu, maar dat was binnen de gestelde technische eisen. Alle experts die RTL Nieuws raadpleegt, zeggen dat de regeling in de Wegenverkeerswet over de bijzondere bromfiets juist geen melding of toetsingsplicht aangeeft. De minister volhardt: ''Wanneer de fabrikant het toegelaten voertuig wijzigt, moet dit altijd worden gemeld bij het ministerie."" Uit ons onderzoek blijkt dat datzelfde ministerie in 2017 tegen een fabrikant van een andere 'bijzondere bromfiets' iets anders zegt. Namelijk, dat het 'moeilijk blijft een exacte grens te trekken over wat wel of niet is toegestaan'. Die valt niet te geven. Het hoofd van de afdeling Verkeersveiligheid en Wegvervoer schrijft: ''U moet hier uw eigen verantwoordelijkheid volgen. Zolang de oorspronkelijke constructie geen geweld wordt aangedaan, is er geen probleem."" Het ministerie wil verder ook geen overleg met deze fabrikant. Als de veiligheid verbetert, zijn aanpassingen geen probleem. Dit was exact de reden voor de stint om een zwaardere motor te nemen; die remt beter. Dat het ministerie weet dat hier iets niet klopt, blijkt ook uit een brief die het ministerie op 3 oktober naar alle fabrikanten van bijzondere bromfietsen stuurt. Daarin drukt het ministerie de bedrijven op het hart om veranderingen aan het product in het vervolg vooral te melden. Volgens jurist Werner van Bentem, die een kinderopvang in Almere bijstond in een kort geding tegen de minister, is de informatie die de minister aan de Tweede Kamer geeft ronduit misleidend. Het zit hem zo dwars dat hij hier afgelopen donderdag een brief stuurde naar het parlement. Opvallend is dat ook de Landsadvocaat de stelling van de minister niet overneemt Ook dit document is niet openbaar, net zoals het gespreksverslag van 29 en 30 september, waarin ILT aankondigt dat de inspectie maatregelen zal nemen. Maatregelen van ILT en RDW blijven uit, omdat de juridische basis daarvoor niet zorgvuldig kan worden onderbouwd. Er volgt geen 'recall' op last van de RDW. De ILT handhaaft zelf ook niet – de ILT geeft geen formele opdracht aan de fabrikant om alle Stints terug te roepen of stil te zetten. De fabrikant zou zo'n opdracht hebben kunnen aanvechten via de rechter. Daarom besluit de minister 'uit voorzorg' te schorsen, omdat er 'potentiele veiligheidsrisico's' zijn, en er twijfel is over de stint. Tijd dus voor TNO-onderzoek. Het is het begin van het einde van de stint. Wie de paniek en de misleiding wil begrijpen, moet terug naar 2008. Dan geeft een ruime meerderheid in de Tweede Kamer het ministerie de opdracht om de Segway (foto) toe te laten tot het verkeer. Omdat dat strijdig lijkt met Europese regels, verzint het ministerie een oplossing, en wordt de Segway gedoogd. Eigenlijk is een nationale oplossing alleen mogelijk voor een voertuig dat niet harder gaat dan 6 km per uur, op het voetpad. Maar het ministerie komt er achter dat de Europese regels gebruik op de weg 'niet verbieden', althans niet expliciet. Het is niet de bedoeling van Europa, maar als Nederland belooft dat men een 'notificatie' naar Brussel stuurt, is er geen haan die ernaar kraait. Er ontstond de mogelijkheid om 'nationaal iets te regelen'. In 2011 wordt die wetgeving voorbereid. De Rijksdienst voor het Wegverkeer (RDW) krijgt op 5 april 2011 een briefje van het ministerie. De gebruikelijke, grondige typegoedkeuring vervalt, juist omdat het een bijzondere bromfiets is. Of de RDW voortaan wil toetsen aan een paar technische eisen, en klaar. De RDW antwoordt op 27 april 2011. Die brief liegt er niet om. Medewerkers van de RDW hadden het al duidelijk aangegeven tegen het ministerie. Strijdig met de Europese regels, vindt de RDW. Maatregelen om toe te zien op 'conformiteit' van de nieuwe voertuigen ontbreken. De RDW kan maar één voertuig testen. Er is dus geen zicht of controle op het hele productieproces, zoals gebruikelijk. Met andere woorden: na de toelating is er geen kwaliteitscontrole en toezicht. De RDW vroeg om aanpassing van de plannen. Op  4 juli 2011 komt er een antwoord van het ministerie, met excuus voor de late beantwoording. Nee, we gaan de boel niet aanpassen, zegt de directeur Wegen en Verkeersveiligheid. Dit is juist de bedoeling. Het is waar dat controle en toezicht afnemen, en het is waar dat na de toelating de RDW voertuigen niet meer ziet. Er zijn een paar technische eisen gesteld, en that's it: ''Daardoor is er inderdaad minder toezicht door de overheid op bijzondere bromfietsen dan op andere voertuigen."" De directeur concludeert: ''Dit risico wordt, gelet op de kleine aantallen, aanvaardbaar geacht."" Het alarmerende advies van de RDW wordt al die jaren verzwegen. Het ministerie geeft het stuk ook niet vrij op 21 september, als de minister zegt dat zij na Oss alle feiten op een rij heeft gezet. Het document wordt ook niet vrijgegeven als de minister besluit de stint te schorsen. De correspondentie wordt pas vrijgegeven op 18 oktober 2018, na de rechtszaak over de schorsing, 's avonds – nadat de Tweede Kamer erom heeft gevraagd. Als je terugleest wat de toenmalig minister van Verkeer en Waterstaat in 2008 zei, bij de introductie van de eerste bijzondere bromfiets (de Segway) dan valt eigenlijk alles op zijn plaats: ''Tegelijk moeten wij de zaken wel juridisch kunnen regelen. Mijn ambtgenoot van Justitie heeft in het algemeen overleg ook gesproken over zaken als aansprakelijkheid. Ik heb eerder ook gezegd dat wij, hoe geinig deze nieuwe step ook mag zijn, ook moeten bedenken hoe wij zouden reageren wanneer er ongelukken gaan gebeuren.""",0.9992,71,33
71,https://www.lifegate.com/larantuka-straits-tidal-power-indonesia,2018-06-11,www.lifegate.com,Newspaper/Magazine,Larantuka straits tidal power Indonesia,1,"Larantuka Straits, Indonesia will be home to the largest tidal power plant in the world It will serve 100,000 people and help overcome some of the challenges of energy provision in Indonesia. The largest tidal power plant in the world will be built in the Larantuka Straits in the island of Flores, eastern Indonesia: it will provide energy for at least 100,000 people. Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 17,500 islands, with nearly 260 million people occupying less than half of these, which means that building efficient energy provision infrastructure is a challenge, particularly in the eastern part, where the islands are small (except for Papua) and spread over a wide area. Whilst the country relies mostly on coal, as it has significant reserves of this dirty fuel that can be extracted and processed at a low cost, about 20 million people remained without electricity in 2017. In addition, it has significant unutilised renewable energy potential, including a total of 60 gigawatts from tidal waves. As has been widely demonstrated, the use of fossil fuels is ridden with serious problems, including increasing costs, depleting resources and the negative impact of coal-based plants on surrounding communities and the environment. Also, it puts Indonesia among the biggest contributors to climate change. Its government has made a commitment to increasing the share of renewable energy in national energy provision, from the current level of a little under 8 per cent to almost a quarter by 2025 (through government regulation 79/2014). This will be aligned with international climate change mitigation efforts, with the country stating it will voluntarily reduce emissions by around a third by 2030. About 314 million tonnes of CO2 are expected to be cut from the energy sector. Renewable energy is actually an effective solution for an extensive archipelago such as Indonesia, as small islands and remote areas are mostly not connected to the electricity grid. Stretching the grid to these from the nearest major islands is also too costly and has been proven to be ineffective. Instead, renewable energy can be harvested directly on small and remote islands. The Larantuka Straits project will begin with the construction of the Pancasila-Palmerah Bridge that will function as a barrage (dam) where state-of-the-art turbines turbines will be installed to transform the kinetic energy of tides’ rise and fall of the tides into electricity. As simple as that. The construction, which should be complete by 2020, is integrated with other development projects that will represent an economic boost for more than 250,000 people, as well as a concrete contribution to mitigating climate change. Following completion of a feasibility study that included an environmental impact assessment, the government formed a consortium to run the project. According to Strukton International, one of the companies responsible for cosntructing the tidal bridge, it is estimated that the first phase of the project will absorb 200 million dollars in investments and will have an installed capacity of 18 to 23 megawatts, though tidal power in the area has a potential of 300 megawatts. The following stage will see the extension of the power plant to a capacity of 90 to 115 megawatts, backed by another 350 million dollars in investments. By then it is expected that the structure could provide energy for about half a million people. The project is doubly aimed at establishing reliable energy provision and boosting local infrastructure, states Luhut Pandjaitan, Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs. The 800-metre bridge will connect Adonara Island to the eastern tip of Flores, enabling economic activity to be opened up. It will also be integrated with a container hub as part of President Joko Widodo’s Sea Toll Programme to turn the country into a global maritime hub, as well as the extension of Gewayantana Airport’s runway. Indonesia is one of the most thriving economies in the world, where growth is stable at about 5-6 per cent per year. Its huge population creates a large domestic market, where nearly 60 per cent of growth is fuelled by private consumption backed by a growing and affluent middle class. The government is aware that this positive trend can only last if the underpinning factor, which is infrastructure, is well-developed. Economic growth can only stand on adequate roads, ports, airport, railways, water provision structures and power plants, over all regions. And all these require energy. Joko Widodo’s administration has been working on a very ambitious infrastructure development programme. To support this, a fast-track policy has been launched to add 35,000 megawatts of new power by the end of its term in 2019, and the the Larantuka Straits tidal power plant will contribute to this objective. Tidal energy is released by tidal movements as a result of the gravitational and centrifugal forces of the Earth, moon and sun, resulting in two high tides and two low ones for every landmass. These occur at regular times during the day, meaning that this form of energy is stable, periodic and predictable. This also differentiates them from oceanic currents, which are slow-moving and unpredictable. Tidal energy involves the installation of clean infrastructure undersea and its efficiency is high. For example, compared to wind power, which applies similar technology, the output of tidal power is 80 per cent higher because water is much denser than wind. The highest tidal ranges, the difference between its low and high points, in the world include the Baie du Mont-Saint-Michel in France (13.5 metres), Severn Estuary in the UK (15 metres) and the Bay of Fundy in Canada (16 metres). The tidal range in Larantuka Straits has been evaluated to be adequate, meeting the required speed for energy production, therefore moving Indonesia in the right direction to fuel the growth of its booming economy whilst respecting the limits of the environment.

Strukton Civiel is the company designated as the preferred provider for the major renovations and modifications at and around Groningen station. This means that it is also largely known what the station and its surroundings will look like after the renovation. The design is based on sustainable, robust and reusable materials. Trees and greenery are also given a prominent place. The monumental roofs and the signal box will be retained and will become important again. The new platform covers are inspired by the existing ones and art is given an important place in the pedestrian passage. Old and new form a coherent whole in this design. The plan includes a larger bus station, more and longer train platforms, 8,000 bicycle parking spaces, a bicycle tunnel and a wide pedestrian passage that connects the north and south sides of the city and the extension of the tracks. The aim of the adjustments is that travelers can reach their destination even more comfortably, faster and easier in the future. The Strukton Civiel team includes Koen van Velsen architects, RoyalHaskoningDHV, Robert Jan Vos, TAK restoration architects and artist Gabriel Lester. In addition to price, their tender scored best on criteria such as design, sustainability, limitation of nuisance and connection to monumental parts of the station. The design by Koen van Velsen architects takes as a starting point that Groningen already has a beautiful station building and draws inspiration from this. Alderman Roeland van der Schaaf of the municipality of Groningen is enthusiastic: “Our beautiful main station will soon be even more beautiful and functional. In this way, the southern inhabitants of the city of Groningen will soon be able to reach the city center under the station and the station will have a fully-fledged southern entrance. In addition, our monumental signal box will be given a prominent place and there will soon be plenty of room for bicycles again, completely in line with Groningen as a cycling city.” Work on the station is expected to start in 2020. The tender design will be worked out in more detail in the coming months. The final award is expected at the end of October. It will then be clear whether Strukton Civiel, as the preferred provider, will receive the order definitively. Due to the growth of the economy and the associated increasing demand in the construction industry, a total of 26 million extra budget is needed to get all project components of Groningen Spoorzone implemented. In the coming period, the parties will jointly look for a solution to raise this additional budget. The adjustments to Groningen's main station fall under the Groningen Spoorzone project, part of the Northern Netherlands Railway Plan. For more information: www.groningenspoorzone.nl.

73,https://www.railjournal.com/in_depth/riyadh-metro-megaproject-reaches-halfway-mark/,2018-10-15,www.railjournal.com,Newspaper/Magazine,Riyadh metro megaproject reaches halfway mark,1,"Riyadh metro megaproject reaches halfway mark Keith Barrow looks at this mammoth project and its potential impact on this rapidly-growing city. The Saudi capital is making rapid progress with its $US 23bn project to build six metro lines by the end of the decade, with construction reaching 50% completion in early 2017. Keith Barrow looks at this mammoth project and its potential impact on this rapidly-growing city. PERHAPS unsurprisingly for the capital city of the world’s largest oil producing nation, the private car has had a defining impact on the urban landscape of Riyadh. In the early 1950s, when Riyadh was home to just 80,000 people, a new planning policy was adopted which designed new residential areas around a grid system, with wide arterial roads linking these expanding communities to the urban core. Over following decades the city continued to expand rapidly, with population growth averaging 8.2% between 1974 and 1992. Riyadh’s population rose from 5.4 million in 2010 to 6.5 million in 2016 and is projected to reach 8.3 million in 2030 - the equivalent of 26 new residents per hour. The High Commission for the Development of Arriyadh has acknowledged that congestion, pollution, and reduced mobility will constrain economic growth unless it takes radical steps to reorganise the transport network and develop a system that works for a much larger city. By 2030, the number of daily car trips is projected to double from 7.4 million to 15 million and the number of hours spent on the city’s roads will climb from 2 million to 4.7 million as the average speed of a journey plummets from 45km/h to 18km/h. The road network is expanding to meet the challenge of a rising population, with more than 1500km of new roads planned by 2030, but in itself this will not be sufficient to prevent gridlock. The solution is to build a sustainable, attractive, world-class public transport network - and build it quickly. By 2019 the King Abdulaziz Project for Riyadh Public Transport will create a 176.7km six-line automated metro network at a cost of nearly $US 23bn, together with a 1230km, 24-line bus network, representing a further investment of $US 4bn. This project - billed as a massive strategic investment in the future of Riyadh - aims to boost public transport’s share of journeys in the city from just 2% to around 20%. In July 2013 Arriyadh Development Authority (ADA) awarded three turnkey design-and-build contracts for the construction of the metro network. By early 2017, this vast undertaking had already reached 50% completion and ADA says it remains on schedule for completion in 2019. The BACS consortium led by Bechtel, and including Aecom, Saudi company Almabani General Contractors, Middle East-based Consolidated Contractors Company, and Siemens, was awarded Package 1, a $US 9.45bn contract for design, construction, rolling stock, signalling, electrification and integration of lines 1 and 2. As E&M partner in BACS, Siemens is supplying 45 four-car Inspiro driverless trains for Line 1 and 29 two-car trains for Line 2, which are being built at the company’s Simmering plant in Vienna, as well as automatic train control systems and electrification for the two lines. Package 2 for the construction of Line 3 is worth $US 5.21bn and was awarded to the Arriyadh New Mobility Group, which is led by Salini Impregilo and includes partners Larsen & Toubro (India), Nesma (Saudi Arabia), Ansaldo STS, Bombardier, Idom (Spain) and WorleyParsons (Australia). Ansaldo STS’ share is worth $US 680m and covers automatic train control (ATC), CBTC, power supplies including third-rail electrification, the operational control centre, telecommunications, and fitting out depots. The contract includes an option for 10 years’ maintenance. Bombardier’s share of the contract is worth $US 383m and includes 47 two-car Innova Metro 300 driverless trains, which are being assembled at the company’s plant in Sahagún, Mexico. In 2015 BACS awarded Larsen & Toubro, India, a $US 161.3m contract to install 62.9km of ballastless track on lines 1 and 2, while Voestalpine is supplying rails and turnouts for the two lines. ThyssenKrupp is supplying 251 elevators and 390 escalators for lines 1 and 2. A joint venture of Parsons, Egis Rail, and Systra was awarded a €425m contract to supervise construction and provide project management services on lines 1, 2, and 3. The $US 7.8bn design-and-build contract for lines 4, 5 and 6 was awarded to the FCC-led Fast consortium, which includes Alstom, Samsung, Freyssinet Saudi Arabia, Strukton, Setec and Typsa. The three lines have a total length of 63.8km (29.8km elevated, 26.6km underground, 8.2km at grade) with 26 stations. Alstom is supplying 69 two-car Metropolis trains, which are being assembled at the company’s plant in Katowice. The company is also supplying its Urbalis communications-based train control (CBTC) system, power supply and its Hesop energy recovery system as part of its e1.2bn contract. Construction supervision services and project management on lines 4, 5, and 6 are the responsibility the Riyadh Advanced Metro Project Execution & Delivery consortium, which comprises Louis Berger and Hill International. Lloyds Register Rail (now Ricardo Rail) was appointed independent safety assessor for all six lines in autumn 2014. In January 2015 ADA awarded Indra a 54-month contract to supply fare collection systems for the metro network and 1000 buses in a deal that includes 10 years’ maintenance. A unified rolling stock design has been adopted for the metro and the three suppliers developed exterior and interior designs for the fleet in collaboration with French design bureau Avant Premiere. The design of the trains was inspired by elements of traditional architecture, with interior and exterior colour schemes appropriate to each line. The metro project includes the construction of 85 stations, including 50 underground, 31 elevated and four at-grade stations. There will be 25 park-and-ride stations and five major interchanges. Seven depots are being built to maintain the rolling stock fleet. ADA has commissioned leading international architects to develop iconic designs for four major stations, which will help to create a distinctive visual identity for the metro. These include King Abdullah Financial District (designed by Zaha Hadid, Britain), Qasr AlHukm (Snohetta, Norway), Western Station (Omrania, Saudi Arabia) and Olaya (Gerber Architekten, Germany). Construction Naturally the logistics of construction reflect the huge scale of the project. ADA has more than 1000 staff working on the project, with 30 nationalities speaking 23 languages. More than 43,000 construction workers are employed on the public transport project, directed from various command centres around the city. Construction activity is scheduled by the hour, around the clock, seven days a week. Infrastructure work includes the excavation of 52km of tunnels using a combination of TBMs, cut-and-cover, and the New Austrian Tunnelling Method. Extensive viaduct construction is also required, and six different construction methods are being used to build the elevated sections of the network, which total 87.4km. On Package 3, the Fast consortium is employing the Full-Span Launching Method (FSLM), the first time this technique has been used in the Middle East. Full-span girders weighing up to 450 tonnes are pre-cast and lifted into a girder carrier, which transports them across the existing spans to a launching gantry, which lifts them into their final position. Fast is installing 256 spans using FSLM. ADA estimates that by the end of the first quarter of 2017, contractors will have excavated 15 million cubic metres of earth, poured nearly three million cubic metres of concrete, and used more 400,000 tonnes of steel. Utilities diversions alone are a vast undertaking - to date ADA has arranged the relocation of more than 170km of power cables, 43km of water mains, 38km of telecoms lines, 18km of sewage pipes and 26km of irrigation channels. So far, the metro project has involved more than 230 million man hours of work. ADA says a key challenge has been unifying the various elements of a complicated and multifaceted contract into a focussed and accountable schedule of deliverables. Before groundbreaking in April 2014, extensive discussions were held with all of the consortia to prepare detailed strategies for the implementation of each construction programme. In addition to its role as project owner, ADA’s responsibilities include facilitating relationships between stakeholders and the organisation manages a wide range of resource issues for the contractors and consultants. ADA’s project office in Oruba employs a matrix system with a ‘one-stop’ work group in direct contact with various stakeholders. Representatives from the Ministry of Transportation, the municipality of Riyadh, the traffic police, and all the various utility companies are seconded to the project offices to enable a rapid and co-ordinated response to any issues. ADA says adding this extra layer of management over the stakeholders and developing empowered teams across seven organisations has been extremely successful and opened the path to the critical scheduling of construction phases. With construction underway simultaneously at hundreds of worksites across the city and significant impacts on the city’s road network, mitigating disruption to communities and businesses has been a paramount consideration and ADA says that from the outset it has aimed for ‘total transparency’ in its communications. As well as engaging the public, ADA also sought to encourage the city’s residents to take ownership of the metro project. The extent of this task reflects the scale and complexity of the metro project and a range of channels including social media and public meetings have been used to establish regular two-way communication with the community. ADA has sought to ensure its call centre phone number is widely known, which enables the escalation of any issues through the organisation’s hierarchy. ADA is encouraging Riyadh’s population to keep looking ahead to the opening of the network, which will have an immediate impact on mobility in the city. Ridership is forecast to reach 1.16 million passengers per day during the initial phase of operation, ultimately increasing to 3.6 million passengers per day. ADA anticipates the metro and bus network will cut car usage by 803 million journeys per year or 10.9 billion vehicle-km. This is expected to reduce the cost of congestion to Riyadh’s economy by around $US 320m per year. ADA calculates that every $US 1 spent on public transport in the city will generate $US 3.40 in economic returns. The public transport project will undoubtedly have a transformative impact on mobility in Riyadh, equipping the city for future growth and achieving in the space of just a few years what many cities have strived for over a period of decades. While few cities could realistically afford to build so much so quickly, Riyadh demonstrates a confidence in public transport that others would do well to emulate",0.006,74,35

They need more modern options like Big Data, a process aimed at analyzing and systematically extracting information from data sets that are too large or complex to handle via traditional processing methods. Through the process, railroads can convert data into usable information that can help them better plan annual maintenance and capital programs. Since Big Data is growing in value as railroads continue to gather and process more information generated from technological advances, the University of Delaware offers a conference each year that focuses on the trending topic — specifically, data analytics and associated statistical analysis techniques. The sixth iteration of the Big Data in Railroad Maintenance Planning Conference was held Dec. 11-12, 2019, at the Trabant University center in Newark, Delaware. The event is organized by the University of Delaware’s railroad engineering and safety program, Big Data center and professional engineering outreach arm. The 2019 edition aimed to expand on previous years’ conferences by introducing new and emerging analysis techniques, and showing how they can be applied to the large volume of inspection data collected by railroads, says Allan Zarembski, a University of Delaware professor who directs the conference. The more than 30 presentations were targeted at helping railroads improve their capital and maintenance program planning efforts, including for both track infrastructure and rolling stock. “We usually have had mostly a track audience, but we’re finding that more and more people want presentations on the mechanical side or operating side,” says Zarembski, who also is the director of the university’s railroad engineering and safety program. “They want to learn about different approaches.” Speakers hailed from a wide range of rail industry stakeholders, including Amtrak, BNSF Railway Co., CN, CSX, Brazil’s MRS Logistica, the Federal Railroad Administration, Penn State Altoona, State University of New York at Buffalo, Alstom, Railinc, Georgetown Rail Equipment Co., Plasser & Theurer, Strukton Rail, ENSCO Inc. and Uptake Technologies Inc. Presentations addressed managing data and data analytics, combining data streams with different technologies, using machine learning to focus on maintenance needs and employing text mining in data analysis. Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task using patterns and inference. Rutgers University Professor Trefor Williams and Collaborative Solutions LLC Managing Member John Betak discussed the use of topic modeling — or text mining — to identify overriding themes in U.S. and Great Britain rail accidents, says Zarembski. “They talked about using word recognition technology to analyze rail accidents, to look for words that are often repeated in accident reports,” he says. “There’s more to data analysis than just crunching numbers.” The sessions helmed by several universities offered more aggressive takes on data analytics, such as pattern recognition techniques, Zarembski says. For example, Milan Afzalan, Farrokh Jazizadeh Karimi and Mehdi Ahmadian from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University — or more commonly Virginia Tech — talked about assessing track conditions by using scalable onboard data and machine learning. A major conference highlight was the Dec. 11 keynote address from Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) General Manager Jeff Knueppel, says Zarembski. Knueppel — who retired at 2019’s end — described the authority’s journey with Big Data, an effort aimed at forging a more effective organization. SEPTA is counting on Big Data to help improve safety and the customer experience, optimize spending and workforce planning, spur more informed decisions, and eventually increase the predictability of operations, maintenance and capital programming. The authority long has tried to replace old manual and formulaic processes with automated ones, says SEPTA Director of Innovation Erik Johanson, who helped with Knueppel’s presentation and reviewed it last month. For example, real-time remote condition monitoring of assets can provide automatic alerts of any unusual conditions. SEPTA has employed a TekTracking LLC remote monitoring system proof of concept at its 40th Street trolley portal. Such automation is targeted to help authority officials better understand the root causes of problems, recalibrate maintenance intervals and — over time — increase the potential to predict component failures. SEPTA has nearly reached the automated stage and now is in the preliminary stages of moving toward the predictive stage, which is the “holy grail,” says Johanson. To be predictive, the authority will need to evaluate and invest in new data sources, promote data-driven decision making and turn data into actionable insights. “Data now is in silos, so we need to break them down,” Johanson says. “The goal is to have an organizational pool of data that everyone has access to.” Service quality would improve substantially because arrival times would be more predictable, he says. Plus, maintenance personnel would know when switches or other components would fail. “You can better understand various aspects of your business,” Johanson says. For now, as part of the ongoing automation push, SEPTA continues to implement a new fare card system featuring an open payment system that requires no tokens or paper fares. The authority wants to continue leveraging data to modernize and boost efficiency, including the constant search for better ways to gather, store and disseminate all data sources, says Johanson. For example, SEPTA continues to adopt a second generation of an automated passenger counter (APC) technology that’s more sophisticated than the prior generation. The APC provides time-stamped and geocoded data with limitless analytical potential, and affords opportunities for customer rewards or more dynamic pricing, says Johanson. SEPTA also employs cellular modems on all buses and most of its rail fleet. A radio-based dispatch system previously polled the location of a rail car or bus every three minutes, but the modems poll every 30 seconds, providing better vehicle locations for customers, says Johanson. Coupled with a new mobile application, the modems also help improve fleet management and scheduling. “It’s all about going from old to better ways for a predictive platform,” Johanson says. The future in leveraging data will focus on safety and inspections, such as the use of GPS-enabled drones to inspect infrastructure above ground and GPS-denied drones to inspect tunnels or subways underground using special sensors, he says. In addition, SEPTA is considering or adopting the use of ground-penetrating radar and ultrasonic testing devices for inspections. Rail asset inspections and maintenance in a Big Data context also were the crux of a Dec. 11 presentation conducted jointly by CSX and VisioStack Inc. The session was a prime example of leveraging advanced data analytics, says the University of Delaware’s Zarembski. CSX Manager of Inspection and Records Stephen Love and VisioStack Data Scientist Joshua Doran discussed the Class I’s use of VisioStack’s RaiLinks™ tool for rail inspections and maintenance. CSX and VisioStack began working together in early 2018 to better align and synch the massive amounts of inspection and maintenance data the railroad was generating from many sources, says Love, who reviewed the presentation last month. The VisioStack data alignment tool enables CSX to visualize and disseminate data on cell phones, tablets and laptops, he says. Data — including high-resolution images and potential rail defects — is gathered from unmanned and manual test cars, other detection cars, LIDAR devices and visual inspections conducted by field inspectors. The tool is designed to support data organization, searches and sharing on a high scale. “We can see changes in data over time, see what’s trending or if there’s been a critical exception,” Love says. “It helps with making decisions — we can better plan work windows and how capital dollars are spent.” CSX began to provide RaiLinks to field managers in second-quarter 2019, and more than 100 of them now use it. The Class I plans to continue developing the tool with VisioStack while gathering feedback from users, says Love. “It’s customizable, so it can be suited to our needs,” he says. CSX aims to roll out RaiLinks to field personnel in the second quarter. The tool currently is used for track maintenance, but there will be other applications in the future, says Love. In 2018, the railroad covered more than 57,000 miles of track with test cars, but in 2019 — after using an unmanned test car and the VisioStack tool for the first time — about 200,000 miles of track were covered. “Without the tool, that would have been very difficult to do,” Love says. CSX expects to cover even more track miles in 2020 because the railroad will be using a total of three unmanned test cars, he says. Such positive results from Big Data are driven by research and development, and the academic world plays a large role in R&D. To that end, the University of Delaware aims to incorporate graduate students’ projects into the conference through poster sessions. Held in conjunction with an evening reception on Dec. 11, the sessions enabled seven graduate students to display and explain their research. “Many found the opportunity to talk to the students very enlightening,” Zarembski says, adding that the university might expand the poster sessions at the 2020 conference. One thing that likely won’t change at the next event: the attendance fee. The conference is free because the university relies on sponsors to cover costs, says Zarembski. The 2019 edition drew six platinum and seven gold sponsors. “We have heard from people that it’s easier for them to attend if they don’t have to worry about a fee,” says Zarembski.

 The new plant, known as the Palmerah Tidal Bridge, will be built into a floating 800 metre-long bridge on the Larantuka Strait in East Flores, and promises to deliver power capacity of 18 to 23 megawatts (MW), providing enough electricity for 100,000 people in the area. It is the first deal to emerge from a strategic hydropower alliance between the Indonesian and Dutch governments. A second phase of construction could see capacity increased to 90 to 115 MW, enough power for more than half a million Indonesians in a region that largely relies on polluting diesel generators for electricity. An artist’s impression of the Palmerah Tidal Bridge. Image: Tidal Bridge BV  Environmental group Greenpeace has said that it approves of the project as an alternative to coal in fossil fuels-dependent Indonesia, but that caution is needed to ensure that the biodiversity of the marine environment is not affected. Tidal power is a relatively uncommon form of renewable energy that harnesses the energy of marine currents, a potentially more reliable power source than wind or the sun. The International Energy Agency estimates that in 2014, global tidal power capacity was about 0.5GW, compared to 128GW of solar and 8.8GW of offshore wind. Indonesia is an ideal location for tidal power, because of strong ocean currents that move between the world’s largest archipelago’s thousands of islands. The Larantuka Strait between Flores and Adonara is one such area, with a number of sites now being considered by the Indonesian government. The Palmerah Tidal Bridge is also being trumpeted as a way of improving grid connectivity in the eastern part of Indonesia, and giving people in the area better access to education, healthcare and job opportunities. The project has been awarded to Tidal Bridge BV, a joint venture between Dutch engineering firm Strukton International and venture capital fund Dutch Expansion Capital. It is slated to be completed by 2019 at a cost of US$550 million. The companies behind the project claim Palmerah Tidal Bridge will be the largest tidal power facility in the world. However, South Korea’s Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station, with power output of 254 MW, has around double the capacity of the Palmerah project, as does the Rance Tidal Power Station in France, with power capacity of 240 MW. Greenpeace Indonesia climate and energy campaigner Hindun Mulaika told Eco-Business that the organisation supported the development of renewable energy in Indonesia, a country that is a big coal extractor and user, and continues to approve plans to build new coal-fired power plants to meet its growing energy demands. Around 50 million Indonesians are without reliable electricity, and president Joko Widowo’s 35,000 MW plan to electrify the country is slated to use mostly coal (20,000 MW, or 57 per cent) to deliver power to those without it. A report by Greenpeace released in January predicted that if plans to build new coal power plants go ahead in Indonesia, it will suffer more deaths as a result of air pollution than any country in Southeast Asia. Hindun said that the group “supports the development of renewable energy to foster the transition away from huge coal dependencies in the country.” “We found a perfect example in Palmerah Tidal Power Plant where the energy source can be found in local resources, which will surely cut distribution costs that commonly occur in big centralised power plants,” she noted. “But for any renewable project that is developed in Indonesia, it needs to be based on comprehensive research, in this case fish passage design for the tidal bridge and power plant development for the mitigation measures,” she said. “The project design and its implementation should consider and ensure it does not harm the environment and biodiversity, particularly marine mammals, turtles and whale sharks and their ecosystems,” added Hindun, stressing that the environmental assessment of this project should also take into account migration routes of fish and other marine mammals.  The tidal plant should also allow fishermen to pass through the straight easily, and consideration is also needed for the potentially increased sedimentation above and below the dams, so as not to impact local fisheries, she said. Eric van den Eijnden, chief executive officer, Tidal Bridge, told Eco-Business that research had been done to assess the environmental impact of the bridge on biodiversity in the area, and that the consequences would be “very limited”. He said that water speed would decrease as a result of the bridge, but this has “no known” environmental consequences. Eco-Business has requested for Tidal Bridge BV to share the results of its research, including the likely impact on local communities. The company has yet to produce its findings.  Van den Eijnden added that fish mortality at the hands of the massive turbines that power the plant would be “negligible” because the turbines are “fish-friendly”— designed to prevent fish from being crushed when they pass through it. Van den Eijnden added: “[Local] fishermen are very enthusiastic because we respect the shipping lanes and they can use the electricity to build cool cells. With this [electricity], they are able to freeze the catch and are thus able to build up a proper industry.”  Tidal power has proved to be controversial in Korea, home of the world’s largest tidal power plants, despite the technology’s renewable status. Environmental groups and fishermen in Korea have predicted that large tidal power plants will bring about deep and lasting harm to tidal ecosystems, fisheries and the landscape. They have also complained about a lack of environmental impact studies to investigate the potential impact of tidal power plants.

The ex-chair of Chiltern Railways now leads Vivarail, which bought much or all of the D78 stock from TfL – about 150 driving motor cars and enough vehicles altogether to form 75 units of two or three car trains. With electrification timescales looking shaky, there could be a growing need for diesel alternatives in the short to medium term, which Vivarail think they can provide. Their vision is for a new, cheap 60mph DEMU that could plug the gap – using Ford automotive engines on re-engineered District Line stock that originally came into service in 1980. Although the RMT union and others have criticised the trains as “London’s cast-offs” and branded them 'Crawlers' because of their speed, Shooter insisted in an interview with RTM that the D-Train has so many elements being replaced or upgraded that “this is effectively a new train – but we’re making it very affordable by reusing the body shell, which is aluminium and has no corrosion, and the bogies, which are only about 10 years old”. This is where Vivarail has gotten lucky. The original bogies from the D78 stock “fell to pieces”, as Shooter put it (they were too rigid and suffered cracking on the inconsistent District Line track), and from 2000-03 were replaced with Bombardier bogies (Adtranz, then) that are still in good condition, the same as used on the 1995 Stock on the Northern Line. “The result is a train that is very affordable but it will have a lot of absolutely up-to-date facilities, in terms of the engines and the alternators, the IGBT electronic power control and a number of other features and communications systems,” Shooter said. Conversion Vivarail received the first of the D78 stock on 19 January and the conversion began immediately. All of the existing DC control gear, including cam shaft control and all of the underfloor equipment used on Underground trains, was removed from the driving cars. This will be replaced by two 3L Ford Diesel engines combining to create 400hp for each driving car, plus a modern alternator and inverter with an output of 750v DC, plus a compressor. The trains will also have IGBTs (insulated gate bipolar transistors) made by Strukton Rail in Holland, and while early versions of the D-Train will come with rheostatic braking, Vivarail is looking to fit later models with a braking system that recovers and reuses the energy. “We’ve got some recycled parts clearly, but people really aren’t that bothered about bogies provided they’re unobtrusive and work and the same with the body shells,” Shooter said. “Our principal objective is that when passengers travel in this train they say ‘Isn’t this a fantastic new train?’ That’s our desired end.” Vivarail plans to have its prototype up and running on the test track at Long Marston by June, and approved by the autumn to run out on Network Rail track. Lightweight and low maintenance The D-Train will come with several notable benefits: at 25 tonnes per vehicle in the three-car formation, they will be a lot lighter than other trains (a Class 150 comes in at 35 tonnes). That helps keep fuel consumption low, as do the modern automotive engines, which shut off when the train idles. Shooter has focused on finding ways to “substantially reduce maintenance costs”, such as designing the engine units and bogies to be easily removable and replaceable. He claims the engine units can be swapped out in 10 minutes and Vivarail has also designed a notional depot that would allow the bogies to be swapped very quickly too. After Vivarail has finished overhauling the train, replacing the lights with modern LED lighting, and all the old components, there will be very little other than the bogies and engines that will require maintenance. Shooter says this gives the D-Train a big bonus: maintenance can be kept local to the line it is operating on. “There are quite a few branch lines around the country that are a long way from a maintenance depot. It might make sense to put a ‘mini-depot’ somewhere along the line, because this train does not need to go back to a proper, conventional maintenance depot,” he said. “Now if you think about the fact that you can start to keep these trains local to the line where they operate, it means that you haven’t got to waste a lot of time and money in sending them miles to a maintenance depot. That incurs fuel cost, driver cost, track access cost, and also possibly means Network Rail has to keep a line open at times when it would be more efficient for them to get on and be maintaining it at night. So there are a number of angles there and these trains would be very suitable for that.” Commuter routes, not fast routes Shooter has a particular vision where he can see the D-Train being used. Although he couldn’t go into details, he has been in talks with all of the bidders for the next Northern franchise, but he has not contacted anyone bidding for TransPennine Express. “This would not be the right train for somewhere where there’s going to be a lot of faster running. For example, I am not talking to any bidders for the TPE franchise, because the nature of their runs is quite fast running and this is not the right train for that. What this might do of course, is free up some other faster, older DMUs that can then be redeployed on some of those routes.” The D-Train will have a maximum speed of only 60mph, although it does have relatively good acceleration. Shooter believes this will make it ideal for a route with a lot of station stops. With the different configurations that Vivarail offer for the carriages, it will also be suitable for both long and short routes. Shooter also sees the D-Train as an ideal way to deal with rush-hour commuters. “Take commuting in and out of cities where there’s very heavy crowding on trains that are not going tremendously fast. Because this train is very affordable, one option would be to acquire some just to do a morning trip into the city, park up all day and then bring a load of people out in the evening,” he said. “If it’s not too long a distance what you’d probably do is keep the configuration similar to what they are now, as used on the District Line, and then it’s an efficient way of shifting a lot of people quickly in reasonable circumstances. So that’s one option.” What makes the D-Train ideal for commuter journeys is it is what the old D78 stock was originally designed for. In their original configuration they would come with four doors, making it very efficient in loading and off-loading, reducing station dwell time. However for longer routes, Shooter said that Vivarail will offer alternative configurations with some of the doors taken out to make way for more seating. Getting the Department for Transport on board As promising as the D-Train sounds, it’s hard to imagine it becoming a success without the support of the Department for Transport (DfT), which has been lukewarm on the subject of old District Line stock to say the least – publicly mindful of the potentially bad PR of being seen to replace decrepit Pacers with “London’s cast-offs”. In December a DfT spokesperson told RTM: “There is no government proposal to replace Pacer trains with old London Underground trains. “We are committed to improving services for passengers across the north. We recognise that Pacers fall short of passengers’ expectations, which is why we will be specifically requiring bidders for the next Northern franchise to phase these outdated trains out. These bids must include improved rolling stock. “The industry is best placed to tell us how more modern, better quality trains can be introduced, and it is only right that we look to them as we push ahead with our ambitious plans to transform the north’s rail network.” But Shooter says that things have moved on a lot since then. “We hadn’t been very forthcoming on what we’re doing until relatively recently, so in the absence of knowing what we’re doing, it’s not surprising that people should be sceptical, that’s absolutely fine,” he explained. “What I can say is that we’re now being much more public about what we’re doing and explaining just how much time and money we’ve put into this, which is quite considerable. And of course I’ve been briefing officials at the DfT so that they’re now aware in a great deal of detail what it is that we’re offering to operators.” (Library image of Adrian Shooter) With the rolling stock problems facing the rail network the D-Train could just be the right solution and the right time. But what inspired Shooter in coming up with the scheme in the first place? “I bought some of the last DMUs that were bought in this country, the 172s, which we bought for Chiltern and London Overground. They’re a good train but they’re very expensive,” he said. “So I looked around at what the alternative might be, and the fact that there is going to be, at least for a few years, a shortage of DMUs until electrification catches up. Leasing companies are not going to want to lease something that’s probably got a 40-year life if they can only really see 10 years’ worth of use. So I said to myself, if we could produce something that was affordable, maybe we can fill that gap – so why not do some re-engineering?” Interview by Sam McCaffrey Tell us what you think – have your say below, or email us directly at [email protected] Mick   23/01/2015 at 12:05 What a refreshing attitude from Mr Shooter; cheap and cheerful, an understanding of what the passengers need. Easy to get on and off is just the job for commuters. Probably be ideal on local lines around Bristol, Exeter and Cornwall branches at peak times",0.029,77,52
